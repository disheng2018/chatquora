Shefali Naidu · Amateur fiction writer ​ 53.6K views · 2.2k Upvotes Standing now in front of me was the man I once madly loved. We would meet in college and have tea at the canteen. Our talks would range from physics books to latest Hindi films. I could look into his eyes for hours at stretch. He had that mesmerizing smile which captivated my heart. Was love so enlightening? I wondered. On a rainy day, in the midst of a deserted road he proposed marriage. “Will you be mine forever?” He asked me. ‘Yes.’ I promised. Love bloomed between us and I couldn’t have been happier. But sometimes when you are too happy life gives you a such a jolt you are startled. Both our parents didn’t agree to our alliance. We didn’t have the courage to stand for our love. No-one ever said love and courage goes hand in hand. It’s been 35 years. And now, I can’t believe he is standing in front of me. His smile still is the same. His eyes still had that magic. But soon the little bubble in my heart would burst again. “Mom, meet Sharma uncle. He is Saloni’s father. He has accepted our relationship.” Said my son. I had never thought our paths would cross like this. Probably he was thinking the same. “Namaste ji!” He said. His voice squeaked. Perhaps going through the same turmoil I was going through. ‘Namaste.’ I said. Courageously. We gathered courage.

Karen Long · Drivers Training Instructor (2010–present) ​ 258.9K views · 8.2k Upvotes When I was twenty my parents, who had divorced but were now living together, asked me to go on a weekend trip with them. I was amazed my father would even ask. We weren’t close, I barely spoke to him! He had been physically abusive to my mom, siblings, and especially me my whole life. I ran away from home at 13, married at 16 so I’d never be under his thumb again. Yet suddenly he wants to be cozy! My mom was a sweet but weak woman! She just never knew when to get out. This invitation came on the weekend of my 20th birthday, my dad was insistent I go. I came up with all sorts of excuses. I had to work, my husband had to work, dad was fine with the latter excuse (said just the 3 of us would be great). I knew it was a rotten idea from the beginning, he’d get drunk, they’d fight, I’d be referee. No way! The more he pushed the idea the worse I felt about it, I just knew something was wrong. I finally just said there was no way I’d go we’d already made plans for a birthday party with friends so they went alone. Two days later on my 20th birthday the State Police came to tell me my parents were dead, my father had killed my mother and then committed suicide. From a note he had left it was quite clear why he was so adamant that I came along. My instincts that day told me the trip was a bad idea and yes I was right. I had told mom after the divorce to never let him back in her life but she always thought he would change. I have posted parts of this answer before and just want to say in advance that I am fine with my life. I am happily married to the love of my life with a amazing grown son and grandchildren. I’ve had a lovely full life filled with great times!

Suddenly another man from the crowd shouted that it was a police case therefore nobody should interfere. Nobody came forward to help. Seeing this, the man shouted I am a Magistrate. I will see to it that police will not disturb you in their investigation. On hearing this the people came forward for help and followed his instructions. The couple was taken to the hospital and treatment began. While returning from the hospital, a man from the crowd came and introduced himself as a lawyer in the lower court and asked him that in which court did he work. At this, the man replied, “Sorry Sir!

John Roberts · Happily married for over 51 years, love her more each year. ​ 251.1K views · 17.7k Upvotes I was dating an eighteen years old girl, I was twenty-five years old. I had fallen in love with her, but this scared me because of the age difference. I felt guilty that she had not had a chance to experience a lot of life like I had. She also did not have much of an education having just graduated from high school. I had already graduated from college. I thought the correct thing to do was to break off the relationship giving her time to experience life more fully. I took her out on a date intending to tell her at the end of the date that it was time to go our separate ways. All night long I was rehearsing the speech I was going to give her: It is not you it’s me. You have done nothing wrong It is for your own good Some day you will understand At the end of the date, we were parked in front of her house when I turned to her to give her the speech the words that came out of my mouth were “do you want to get married?” I swear I had never even considered marriage and to this day I have no idea where those words came from. We have now been married for more than fifty-one years and are still deeply in love with each other.

Preethi Gujuluva · Chennaiite ​ 167.3K views · 6.5k Upvotes This is a beautiful story worth sharing :) A son took his old father to a restaurant for an evening dinner. Father being very old and weak, while eating, dropped food on his shirt and trousers. Other diners watched him in disgust while his son was calm. After he finished eating, his son who was not at all embarrassed, quietly took him to the restroom, washed off all the food particles, removed the stains, combed his hair and fitted his spectacles firmly. When they came out, the entire restaurant was watching them in dead silence, not able to grasp how could someone could embarrass themselves publicly like that. The son settled the bill and started walking out with his father. At that point, an old man amongst the diner called out to the son and asked him, “Don’t you think you’ve left something behind?” The son replied, “No sir, I haven’t.” The old man retorted, “Yes, you have. You left a lesson for every son and hope for every father.” The whole restaurant went silent.

As usual, the conversation ended in five minutes. After I had disconnected the call, I thought - What if it was a call from my best friend, would my response have been the same? The answer was a big no and I was unable to figure out why. This restlessness drove me to call him again. Dad: What happened? Are you ok, son? Me: Yes, I’m fine, Dad. Just, missing you a lot. He was surprised at first and thought I needed money. Soon after, I began cracking few jokes (lame ones) to which he laughed his heart out. We talked for straight 40-45 minutes, engaging in topics we had never discussed before. Strangely enough, I felt like talking to a different person. The person whom I had spent my life with, yet knew so little about. The blissful conversation ended with a ‘Stay Blessed’ from his side and a wide smile from mine.

I had read about the marshmallow test. You give a child a marshmallow, and then say that if she (Layla, in this case) could keep from eating it for 10 minutes, you’ll give her a second. So I tried that test with my granddaughter (not with marshmallows, but with chocolate, which she likes much more). According to extensive experiments, children who “pass” the “marshmallow test” are far more successful in later life. They have learned a fundamental truth in life, that delayed gratification can lead to a far better long-term outcome. She sat and watched the chocolate. The 10-minute hourglass finally emptied, and she had succeeded. She asked for her second piece of chocolate. I gave it to her, and she now had two in her hand. That’s when she looked up at me and asked, “Would you like one, Grandpa?” Needless to say, from that moment on I would readily give my life for her.

Akshay ​ 134.8K views · 14.0k Upvotes There is a juice stall, in proximity of my house. The owner is a hard-working guy, who hails from a humble background in Bihar. Someone, who has seen poverty from close quarters. I talk to him every day. A day before yesterday, I could not. ‘He might be unwell or something’, I thought. Yesterday, he did arrive. Surprisingly, the stall was replaced with a single table. And, ‘mango juice’ was the sole item he sold. “What happened?” I asked. “They [corporation] took the stall,” he said. “Oh, now?” “Now, what? I have this,” he tapped the table,” Does it look any less beautiful than the stall?” I was awestruck. The man was snatched of his living, a day before. And, here he was, smiling. Fighting, with whatever he had. Call it a necessity, if you may. Blame it on destiny, if you want. For me, it’s a lesson. Of battling. Of failing. Of taking the blows and yet grinding it out with the chin up. Of hope and helplessness. Of life, and so much more. 展开翻译 待更新（还没腾出时间翻译。。） ▌“Quora文选”词汇: 1️⃣ 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹 &#x2F;stɔ:l, stɔl&#x2F;n. 摊位；v. 熄火，拖延The market was full of stalls selling all kinds of goods.（市场上摆满了卖各种商品的摊位。） 2️⃣ 𝘂𝗻𝘄𝗲𝗹𝗹 &#x2F;ʌn’wel, ʌn’wɛl&#x2F;adj. 不适的，不舒服的She felt unwell and decided to stay home from work.（她感觉不舒服，决定在家休息不去上班。） 3️⃣ 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗽𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 &#x2F;ˌkɔːpə’reɪʃən, ˌkɔrpə’reɪʃən&#x2F;n. 公司，法人The corporation announced a new project this quarter.（该公司宣布了本季度的一个新项目。） 4️⃣ 𝗮𝘄𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝗸 &#x2F;‘ɔːstʃtʃrʌk, ‘ɔːstʃrʌk&#x2F;adj. 敬畏的，惊叹的The audience was awestruck by the magician’s final trick.（观众对魔术师的最后一个魔术感到惊叹。） 5️⃣ 𝘀𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 &#x2F;snætʃ, snætʃ&#x2F;v. 抢夺，抓取The thief snatched the bag and ran off down the street.（小偷一把抓起包就跑下了街道。） 6️⃣ 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻 𝘂𝗽(短语.) 保持积极，不气馁You can achieve your goals with the chin up and a positive attitude.（保持积极的态度，你就能实现你的目标。） https://qr.ae/ps5L0v","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2024年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What is one piece of simple advice that actually changed your life?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2024/04/30/2024/2024-04-30-What is one piece of simple advice that actually changed your life/","content":"What is one piece of simple advice that actually changed your life?

He is a software engineer. Then suddenly depression hit him. It became so severe that when he used to leave for work, he would reach till 2 stations just before his destination, suddenly get anxious and return back home. This continued for months. It went on increasing. He would reach half way, then suddenly return home, to my mom’s surprise. Then one day came when he went only till the station and did not even board the train! Dad wasn’t in a condition to face the world. Thus, he sat at home for 3 years, jobless, and my mom had to get a job as a teacher to make ends meet. To make the matters worse, when we reached out to relatives whom we had helped earlier to ask for some help, they straight out declined. Dad was devastated and angry. And coming to current conditions, he works in Pune as a teacher in some institute and mom too is a teacher in a nearby school. Life is good, but just imagine what it would have been without depression and dad’s unemployment! Coming to the question. Was my dad perfectly happy and hard working at one time? Yes. Did my dad ask for depression? No. But did life give him depression? Yes. Did he lose his job due to it? Yes. Did we lose the chance to live a well off life? Yes. So yeah, life is unfair. But you are a fool if you expect it to be fair. It doesn’t matter how difficult it is. What matters is how you react to life! You can either cry, or you can try!

Abinash Mishra · ​ 177.2K views · 12.1k Upvotes Yesterday I was in Kanpur for my friend’s wedding. In the morning I woke up to people saying , “refused to take the car”. We quickly caught up with everything that happened. It was my friend, the groom who denied to take the car. The First thing he felt was that it was against his self respect since he wants to buy a car with his own money. Secondly, the girl’s father died years ago and her brother and mother worked hard to educate the kids. Her brother ensured that his sister will have the best marriage function. The girl’s family insisted as dowry still plays a part in social prestige in India. But finally my friend was able to convince them and came home with the bride happily without the car. Dowry is a social evil. We all know this. Yet how many stand against it. Even the most educated ones demand the most. Yet this guy stood up to his values and politely refused.

Later,upon seeing him in depression they finally gave in. So, now we are happily married for three years. Two years passed by. Our parents asked us now and then about KIDS. My in-laws are conservative. As most of the Indian parents, they too feel that kids complete the family. They suggested us to consult a doctor. Everyone suggested indeed. At the very sight of the hospital, my husband stopped the car to a side. he held me by the hand and said: “Do we really need children? Look.. My first ever kid is YOU. You complete me. I’m fine with one.” he said in a dejected tone. ALL I COULD DO WAS SMILE. .. thanking the almighty for giving me the most heartful thing ever lived. But this did not end here. We went through the checkup. The reports are out. The doctor revealed in a dejected tone that I CANNOT CONCEIVE. Tears flooded my eyes. That moment, I collapsed to the ground in tears. I’m unable to see anything. Tears obscured my vision. All I remember was him carefully carrying me to the car in his hands. We went home. I went to our bedroom and locked the door. I cried. I cried. Later in the evening my mother-in-law came to our room. She didn’t say anything. After fifteen minutes of complete silence she said, “I’m sorry beta. We never knew this thing about Akansh.” She broke down and left in tears. I was left in an utter dismay. Later upon asking him, he said “I will never cause any pain to you by any means.” He lied to his parents that the problem lies within him. “What did I do to deserve him?” He knows that I could not bear that guilt for longer. He immediately applied for a position in abroad in the same company on a two year contract and here we are, in LONDON away from home, away from everything.

We’d arrived from New York early that morning, pressed on through the day, and by nighttime our body clocks were completely out of whack. At 11 pm I heard my wife get out of bed and go to the bathroom. A minute later she stepped out and said four words I will never forget. How strong are you? She was staining and she was certain she was going to lose the baby. A doctor came to the hotel room. Through the magic of 1971 technology I was able to reach my wife’s obstetrician in New York. He agreed with the Italian doctor’s prognosis and his course of treatment — one progesterone injection per week for three weeks. First shot in Rome, second shot in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, third shot in Athens. It worked, and six months later our son was born. That was 45 years ago. But to this day I will never forget seeing my young wife standing at the foot of the bed, light filtering from the open bathroom door behind her, and asking, “How strong are you?” Nor will I forget my one-word response. “Very,” I lied. 展开翻译 待更新（还没腾出时间翻译。。） ▌“Quora文选”词汇: 1️⃣ 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝗰𝗸 &#x2F;aʊt əv wæk&#x2F;adj. 不正常的，失调的；不协调的；状况不佳After the accident, his whole schedule was out of whack.（事故发生后，他的整个日程都乱了。） 2️⃣ 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻 &#x2F;steɪn&#x2F;n. 污点，斑点，瑕疵；v. 玷污，染污She tried to remove the stain from her shirt with some detergent.（她试图用一些洗涤剂去掉衬衫上的污渍。） 3️⃣ 𝗼𝗯𝘀𝘁𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗻 &#x2F;əbˌstɛtrɪˈʃən&#x2F;n. 产科医生The obstetrician monitored the progress of the pregnancy closely.（产科医生密切监测着妊娠的进展。） 4️⃣ 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘀 &#x2F;prɒɡˈnəʊsɪs&#x2F;n. 预后，预测；病情的判断The doctor gave a positive prognosis for the patient’s recovery.（医生对患者康复给予了积极的预后。） 5️⃣ 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗲 &#x2F;prəˈdʒestəroʊn&#x2F;n. 孕酮Progesterone plays a crucial role in maintaining pregnancy.（孕酮在维持怀孕过程中起着至关重要的作用。） https://qr.ae/psuB9J","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2024年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What is the most heroic thing you have done?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2024/04/27/2024/2024-04-27-What is the most heroic thing you have done/","content":"What is the most heroic thing you have done?

Being an Indian son it is very difficult for me to force him or even talk to him directly on the matter. Even then, I had requested him many times to quit the habit. My mother and all my relatives advised him regularly but he never gave up. One morning some of our relatives were at our place for a family function. Almost 15 to 20 people were present at our place. I took out a cigarette from my pocket and lit it. All the relatives were shocked. A 25 year old boy, how can he dare to smoke and that too in front of all the relatives. My father stood up and slapped me. I just kept looking at him and took another puff. One of my brothers snatched the cigarette from my hand and threw it. Everyone gathered around me and started asking me the reason for such a shameless act. I asked my father why did he slapped me? He said, “How can you smoke in front of your father?” I said, “If you can chew tobacco in front of your father, why can’t I smoke in front of my father?” He just stared at me for a minute and went in his room, brought the tobacco pouch and handed it over to me and said, “today I quit”.

Anonymous · Updated 8y ​ 360.7K views · 24.1k Upvotes I married my rapist. I was in college at that time, and I was struggling to cope with my studies and I had to take care of my ill father. I wasn’t concerned about anything else. My goal was just to finish college with a degree. He, too, attended the same college. We didn’t talk that much, but I did get some signals that he liked me and wanted to date me. But he never once confessed it. I was in my third year, when my father passed away. And practically, I had to live alone since my mother ran away with another guy while I was still a kid. I have no one to rely on, no relative to take care of me. I had no choice but to stay in hostel. One day, it was raining and he offered me a ride back to hostel. I was reading in the library and I had no idea about the time nor the weather. I had to say yes to him since it was dark and I didn’t bring my umbrella. That’s when he raped me- in his car. I was disturbed by that incident that I tried to cut my wrist, but all my attempt ended up in failure. I was into deep depression, and all I thought was how to survive. Then he started to manipulate me and forcing me to marry him. He would usually ask, ‘who’s going to take care of you since you have no family now?’ or ‘how are going to survive in this world with no one by your side?’ or ‘do you know how the people going to look at you if they knew you were raped? they wouldn’t stand by you; they probably think you’re cooking up a story to extort some money from me.’ and ‘no one would believe what you say’. Eventually I did marry him thinking there is no way I can live out in this world. But, I thank god, I didn’t bear any kids with him. Thinking about an innocent soul being born without love scared the hell out of me for all those years. It took me 4 years to realize that I can stand own my own two feet. I got an education, I can get jobs if I apply for one. I wont starve. I wouldn’t die. I divorced him, and now I’m working as IT analyst. I’m only 27, and I still haven’t given up hope in love. I’m still waiting for the one. PS: Sorry for my anonymity. I am comfortable with my self and hopeful of my future, but it’s gonna take a while for me to embrace my past. EDIT: I am overwhelmed by the response and emotional support I have received from so many people here. Also, I want to thank everyone who promoted my answer so it can reach more women like me.

He insisted we get to know each other before tying the knot so we used to date for a while. He wasn’t my type at all but I was under enormous pressure to get married and got tired of seeing boys. I really went into a state of confusion a month before the wedding. He was controlling,manipulative and abusive. He threatened to commit suicide as it’s a prestige issue for him if marriage gets canceled and also blackmailed that he’ll leak our private messages and pictures. I got scared. Even my parents were not supportive about calling it off as they liked him. Finally I decided to say no two days before the wedding as I was very depressed and wasn’t feeling one bit happy about the marriage. It was difficult but I did it. A month after canceling the wedding, we came to know the boy had lied about his age,education and salary in the matrimonial profile and was already married. I was really outraged at my parents for not doing a proper background check on the boy. My gut instincts said “no” from the day I met him. I wish I trusted myself and never gave up for my parents or forced myself into a relationship with him. But anyways it was one of the best decision I made in my life.

She spoke a lot and she was very intelligent but we only had this time together because we were not friends. She was older than me, and we never had 1 on 1 time so it was not the ideal situation to just ask “do you like me?”. So I tested some psychological tricks… Eye Contact I made strong eye contact while smiling when I first entered the room. She always smiled back! Proximity I made sure I picked a chair way in the front of the room and close to where she was sitting. I noticed she began to pay more attention to me! Food I brought her an apple because one day she forgot her lunch, and I wrote a note on a paper, “Do you like me?” The next day we had a big test and I was really nervous because the girl of my dreams had still not responded to my note… after taking the test I sat there patiently twirling in my desk and trying not to look at her. Finally when I received my test back, I was relieved! At least I got an A+ on the test so today wasn’t a complete failure. I flipped the test over and there was a note on the back! “Of course I like you! You are the most positive student in the class and always smiling. You sit in the front and pay great attention, and you are very thoughtful. Thanks for the apple; it was delicious. Don’t forget to study for your exam next week!” Yep, that’s right.

We don’t fight, we don’t “just pick up our backpacks and go for a vacation”, and we don’t indulge in “let’s do something crazy” moments. For (up to now) over twelve years together (including get-to-know-each-other, relationship, and marriage), we haven’t done anything “just because”. Anything we do, we have a plan for it. The love my husband has for me is not the kind of love that the teenage me once dreamed about (I always dreamed that someone would love me like Gatsby loved Daisy). His love is not a love that burns like lava, seething with passion. His love is like the essence of life, filtered through time and crystalizes into a steady, solid, giant rock that I can lean on. His love is so tangible that I feel I could see it and touch it. And I believe it’s the best kind of love one could ever ask for. We often dream about someone that willing to die for love, willing to die for us, and we are willing to die for them. Yet, I’ve come to understand that we don’t need an eventful relationship to feel fulfilled.

I asked him where I could find ketchup. He didn’t know English. But, he realized my dilemma and called his daughter from his cellphone. She talked to me in English and asked me what I needed.

Come here!” My 11-year-old girl dragged me towards the computer. “Dad, please purchase everything I have in the Amazon shopping cart.

These items will get here before Christmas. I have a surprise for everyone… no peeking!” she insisted, and I never hesitated. I purchased everything. A couple of days later she got everything. I saw her then wrapping all her gifts. “Can I help you?” “No, Dad. I told you these are special surprises. Absolutely no peeking!” Her excitement was visible. She was proud. She was alive. She was glowing with happiness. The day came. She couldn’t contain herself. She was all over her gifts, planning, protecting, arranging. Everything had to be perfect. As soon as dinner was over, she jumped up from her chair and took her gifts. She went around, giving each one of us her piece of love. These were small value items, but it was the meaning of her giving heart that we were really feeling. As she gave to each person, she paused. She watched the expression on our faces. Our smiles were her greatest reward. Her last gift was for my back then 2-year-old boy: A rocking pony ride-on toy. It’s hard to describe the explosion of delight that my little boy had on his face when he got this gift! For several minutes, everyone was totally absorbed, our attention taken up watching him go all around the house making it a rodeo arena. Even though the pony is designed to be a static rocking horse — his excitement was so significant that the horse slid a few inches forward or backward with every thrust he exerted into the little toy. My little girl watched, rewarded with a huge smile on her face. Somehow, witnessing these acts of giving love from my 11-year-old helped me understand the power of giving. Giving from the heart. Giving from the inside out. Later that day, my girl received some gifts, but she didn’t need them. She was focused on others, not on herself. It was evident that she was the one feeling true JOY.

Soon after I found out that I was pregnant with our second, I bought a bunch of books for our 3 year old about what it means to be a big sister. We read the books for a few days, and then she told me that she had decided that she wanted to have a baby sister. I told her that if we were going to have another baby, we wouldn’t be able to decide if we wanted a girl or a boy. I also explained that it would sometimes mean that I would have to take care of the baby, and might not always be able to play with her. We talked about it for a while, about her having a sibling to play with, to teach things to, but that it would also be a lot of work for all of us. Babies cry a lot, I said.

He visits India every year with his wife. Every time they visit India they take an auto to roam around the city. They have a rule, whenever they go out and whatever they eat they make sure the auto driver gets the same thing. Once they went to a very popular place, ordered 3 Samosas(Indian snack), gave one to the auto driver. The auto driver took it with a very big smile, said thank you and put it into a carry bag. Uncle asked what happened you are not hungry or something?

The air is fresh. The wind is kind. Birds are chirping. There’s no pollution. There’s no honking. There’s peace. I woke up at 7 o’clock in the morning. Around 8 o’clock I, my parents and my sister had breakfast together. Around 12 o’clock I, my parents and my sister will have lunch together. When the sun will be preparing to disappear I will serve the water to buffaloes. After that, I will gather the fodder for buffaloes and have a bath. After delivering the milk to the nearest dairy, I will return home. Around 7 pm my parents and my sister and I will have dinner together. After dinner we always have this ‘family hours’. We all sit together for an hour or so. We hit the bed as per our wishes. This is the daily routine of mine. During harvest time there’s more work involved. But, even during busy days, there’s one thing common. And that is having meals together. What is success according to me? A peaceful life where you have all your meals together with your family. What’s the point of earning in lakhs working overtime, missing all the meals with your family, and then having only one or two dinners with them in a month in a five star restaurant? Many may disagree with this. But then that’s their point of view. My point is, we have got this one life. Whether you drive Mercedes or Maruti, it’s not important. What’s important is that with whom you drive it. Earning in lakhs and giving your family to spend thousands while you can’t be with them, is meaningless according to me. But, earning in thousands and giving your family to spend in hundreds while being with them is meaningful according to me.

Just by the look of it, I knew it was something basic. I decided to ask the teacher to explain it to me. ‘You are going to do what?! Are you insane? You’ll look so stupid. What will people think?’The voice inside me said. But I needed to understand it! I looked around me and everyone else seemed to be getting it. ‘Don’t do it! Everyone will stare at you. Then probably bully you for being dumb. The whole school will know that you are the stupidest’ “Ma’am, I did not get the previous step.” I cut my thoughts and spoke up. Everyone looked at me. My heart sank. “This part?” The teacher asked “Okay, who can explain this?” The whole class became quiet. Apparently no one understood that part either. Why are people afraid of speaking up? Because they believe that voice inside their head which tells them that they are the stupidest person in the world and that one wrong question will make people shoot them in the head. 展开翻译 待更新（还没腾出时间翻译。。） ▌“Quora文选”词汇: 1️⃣ 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸 𝗨𝗽 &#x2F;spiːk ʌp, spek ʌp&#x2F; phr. 大声点；说出来 Speak up, I didn’t hear what you said.（请大声点，我没听见你说的话。） https://qr.ae/psYer0","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2024年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"Can money buy happiness?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2024/03/30/2024/2024-03-30-Can money buy happiness If yes, and there was no more money in the world, would everyone be unhappy/","content":"Can money buy happiness?

He said it’s too much and they ended up giving the maid only Rs. 500. The maid took 3 days off during Diwali and came back on the 4th day and was visibly happy. The guy asked her, ‘How was your Diwali’? Her answer left the guy speechless She replied, It was very good sir thanks to the money you gave me. I used Rs. 150 for traveling to and from my son’s village. Used Rs. 100 to buy sweets for them all. I bought my grandson a shirt and a pant for Rs. 200.

Bruno Valle · Works at Bain &amp; Company ​ 231.6K views · 14.5k Upvotes I was on a train in France in 2006 - the overnight train from Nice to Rome. Being young backpackers, my friend and I had paid for the cheapest fare possible, which meant sleeping in tight chairs in a packed car. At some point in the middle of the night, I get woken up by a rough hand shaking my shoulder. I looked up to see a tall blonde man in a baseball cap looking down at me. “Someone just took something out of your bag!”, he said to me in an American accent, before waking up a few people next to us which had also been robbed. Once we awakened, he explained “I just saw three guys rummaging through your bags and taking out cash and valuables. When they saw me they went straight to back of the train, we need to get them!” I didn’t think it was safe to confront 3 train robbers in the middle of the night in the last car of a speeding train, so I said “Shouldn’t we tell the conductor first?” The baseball cap guy was seething and clearly didn’t want to wait for the conductor. He said “Ok, you go to the front and tell the conductor, and…” he looked around, trying to find someone or something. His gaze landed on a hulking curled up figure, sleeping under a blanket and cap. This sleeping guy was at least 6’6’’. Baseball cap guy walked towards him shook him roughly “You, hey, wake up, I need your help. Three guys just ran down the train car stealing from bags, we need to get them.” The sleeping guy pulled off his blanket and stood up. He was gigantic, and was wearing an “Australia Rugby” shirt. The baseball guy was clearly satisfied with his new recruit, and they marched to the back of the train followed by the excited group of victims and onlookers. I made my way to the front of the train and alerted the conductor of what was happening – he said he couldn’t do anything until we reached Marseille, when he would ask the “railroad police” to board the train and investigate the thefts. Dejected, I went back to my seat to tell the other travelers about this, but no one was there. I could hear yelling coming from the back of the train so I walked past the next few cars and got there. There was a commotion in front of the last door, as baseball cap guy, Australian rugby guy and 10 other people jostled and yelled at the last door. The 3 suspects had been chased down by the baseball&#x2F;rugby duo and had barricaded themselves in the last car. They were clearly scared, but were screaming back at the crowd in broken English “We have knife! We have knife!”. Soon, baseball&#x2F;rugby duo decided they had enough. The massive Australian rugby player started to kick the door repeatedly, putting his full weight behind each kick. The cutpurses stared at the door after each kick, trying to see how long it could take them. They talked among themselves and made a decision. The trio pulled out thousands of Euros in cash, jewelry and other valuables and dropped them on the ground, saying “Ok! Ok! What you want!” and ran to the back of the last car. Soon team baseball&#x2F;rugby had gotten the door open, but the 3 hoodlums were gone – they had jumped out of the moving train in fear. But baseball cap guy and rugby guy were celebrated as heroes for the rest of the ride. If they hadn’t intervened, the robbers would have escaped with the money when the train slowed down. The baseball cap guy was a retired cop from New York, and the rugby guy just played rugby in university. I think they both deserve “nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.” 展开翻译 待更新（还没腾出时间翻译。。） ▌词汇: 1️⃣ 𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐞 &#x2F;ˈrʌmɪdʒ, -ɪdʒ&#x2F;n. 搜寻，翻找；v. 翻找，搜寻She rummaged through her drawers looking for her missing keys.（她在抽屉里翻找，寻找她丢失的钥匙。） 2️⃣ 𝐬𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞 &#x2F;siːð&#x2F;v. 沸腾，激动，发怒The boiling water began to seethe and bubble.（沸水开始沸腾和冒泡。） 3️⃣ 𝐡𝐮𝐥𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 &#x2F;ˈhʌlkɪŋ&#x2F;adj. 巨大的，庞大的He was a hulking figure, towering over the others in the room.（他是一个庞大的身影，在房间里高高地耸立着。） 4️⃣ 𝐠𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜 &#x2F;dʒaɪˈɡæntɪk&#x2F;adj. 巨大的，庞大的The gigantic elephant dominated the landscape.（巨大的大象主宰了这片土地。） 5️⃣ 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭 &#x2F;rɪˈkruːt&#x2F;n. 新兵，新成员；v. 招募，征募The army recruited young men to join its ranks.（军队征募年轻人加入其队伍。） 6️⃣ 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 &#x2F;kəˈməʊʃ(ə)n&#x2F;n. 骚乱，动乱，喧闹There was a commotion in the street as the protesters clashed with the police.（示威者与警察发生冲突，街上一片骚乱。） 7️⃣ 𝐫𝐮𝐠𝐛𝐲 &#x2F;ˈrʌɡbi&#x2F;n. 橄榄球（运动）He played rugby for his school team.（他为校队打橄榄球。） 8️⃣ 𝐣𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐥𝐞 &#x2F;ˈdʒɒs(ə)l&#x2F;v. 推挤，拥挤，争抢People jostled each other as they tried to get onto the crowded train.（人们互相挤来挤去，试图挤上拥挤的火车。） 9️⃣ 𝐝𝐮𝐨 &#x2F;ˈduːəʊ&#x2F;n. 二人组，双人组合The musical duo performed a beautiful duet together.（这个音乐二重奏一起演奏了一首美妙的二重唱。） 🔟 𝐛𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐝𝐞 &#x2F;ˌbærɪˈkeɪd&#x2F;n. 栅栏，路障，障碍物Protesters erected barricades to block off the street.（抗议者设置了路障来封锁街道。） 1️⃣1️⃣ 𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞 &#x2F;ˈkʌtpɜːs&#x2F;n. 扒手，小偷The cutpurse stole the wallet from the distracted tourist.（扒手从分心的游客那里偷走了钱包。） 1️⃣2️⃣ 𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐥𝐮𝐦 &#x2F;ˈhʊdləm&#x2F;n. 暴徒，流氓The hoodlum was arrested for vandalism.（这个暴徒因故意破坏被逮捕了。） https://qr.ae/pyP6Gt","tags":["Quora文选","2024年"]},{"title":"What makes a teacher the proudest?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2024/03/30/2024/2024-03-30-What makes a teacher the proudest/","content":"What makes a teacher the proudest? Drew Gormley · Teaching for over 20 years. ​ 438.1K views · 17.5k Upvotes I had a student walk into my room after school (half day) before Christmas break. He was “bored.” How he could be bored on the first day of vacation was beyond me. He finally had freedom, and we had only finished school 20 minutes before. So I asked him what he wanted to be as an adult and he said “Lawyer.” My father was a lawyer, studying in his patrolcar while he worked for the police department, and his journey through law school, to his first office in an empty building to his eventual success, ten years into his career, stuck with me always. I felt qualified to help him. I knew how much work it took to succeed in that field. So I told him: “Get the phone book, and call every law firm near you and ask to work for free there. They will say no, your job is to try, their job is to say no. Eventually, you’ll find someone who doesn’t say no.” He left, I forgot about it. Kids usually ignore what you teach. But when I got back from Winter break, he’d already started interning at a law firm, the 21st one he called. The firm later played a key role in his adult life too, so somehow I did a great thing teaching him to work the phone, and not be afraid to hear “NO”. I consider that my biggest teacher victory.

For instance, how often will you go on vacations, and where will you go? What type of food will you eat, and who will cook it? Where will you live, and how clean will the house be? What TV shows and movies will you watch, and how often? When the toothpaste or toilet paper runs out will your partner get more or expect you to? How much sleep will you get?

Jimmy Wales · Wikipedia, Wikia, WikiTribune ​ 1.1M views · 34.2k Upvotes Here’s what I do. Before we play, I ask my daughter if she wants to play “the teaching way” or “straight”. The teaching way” means that after each of her moves, I help her analyze it and suggest improvements and point out any errors that I see. Such games tend to be very closely matched since, after all, it ends up being her+me against just me. But she also enjoys playing straight sometimes, and then what’s fair is fair. I think it’s absolutely a bad idea to let a kid win falsely to boost their confidence - it’s false confidence. But I also don’t agree with a hardcore “never let them win until they force it”. I have found my hybrid “teaching way” to allow me to teach her the game more quickly.

Concentration is nothing but a disease inside our brain, which keeps reminding us our priorities. How to increase your concentration? Increase your priority. If it is important to you, you will find a way. If not, you will find an excuse. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 ▌词汇: 1️⃣ 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗸 &#x2F;prɪk, prɪk&#x2F;v. 刺，刺痛；n. 刺痛感，针刺The rose prick caused a slight pain on her finger.（玫瑰的刺在她的手指上引起了轻微的疼痛。） 2️⃣ 𝗱𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘁 &#x2F;daɪˈvɜːrt, daɪˈvɜːrt&#x2F;v. 转移，使分心；n. 转移，转向We need to divert our attention from our problems and focus on the positive.（我们需要转移对问题的注意力，专注于积极的一面。） 3️⃣ 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 &#x2F;ˌkɒnsənˈtreɪʃən, ˌkɑːnsənˈtreɪʃən&#x2F;n. 集中，专注；浓度She was able to maintain her concentration throughout the long meeting.（在漫长的会议中，她能够保持专注。） 4️⃣ 𝗙𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻&#x2F;ˈfæmɪli ˌfʌŋkʃən, ˈfæməli ˈfʌnkʃən&#x2F;n. 家庭函数，家庭活动The family function was held at the park with games and food.（家庭活动在公园举行，有游戏和食物。） https://qr.ae/ps2C0E","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2024年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What is something you wish you had known sooner?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2024/03/28/2024/2024-03-28-What is something you wish you had known sooner/","content":"What is something you wish you had known sooner? Vijay Odedra · Lives in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India (2021–present) ​ 92.2K views · 4.2k Upvotes A month ago, a distant aunt of mine was mocking and making fun of my fiancée. She was talking about my fiancée’s short height and pointing out that we are not the perfect couple as I am comparatively taller than my fiancée. I shut her mouth by saying that beauty fades away any time and physical appearance is not the only trait one should look for in a partner. She continued her rant and I stopped giving her a cuff. While all this was happening, I was calm inside, as much as I was outside. Her words couldn’t stir my peace for a second also. And I even didn’t regret my decision of choosing her as my partner. I wish I knew, how to stay firm and calm in any situation, years ago. It’s been just two years I am so much composed and confident about my life choices. Years ago I was always worried about others opinions. I sought validation from people around me. I desired appreciation. But these days, I put on a shirt, stand in front of the mirror, and ask myself whether I look good or not. That’s it.

If you don’t clear your misunderstanding in time, they became the reason for distance forever. If you want it, work for it. It’s that simple. The gap between the life you could live and the life you are living is called focus. If you’re not dating to marry, then you’re dating for heartbreak. Let that sink in and be in serious relationship. Stop comparing yourself with who started 10 years before you. Focus on your own journey. Confidence is not “I’m better than them”, confidence is “I’m great, so are they” Every time I lower my frequency to meet someone on their level I end up paying for it. That’s a lesson I really don’t need to learn anymore. Rise up to meet me. Real growth is when you start checking and correcting yourself. Instead of blaming others, you take your power back by being responsible for your life. You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.

Early morning is the best time. OUTSIDE GOOOODDD, INSIDE BAADDD. Always use protection. All your success wouldn’t mean shit if you got an unexpected bun in the oven. Never ever watch porn. No matter what happens, never ever watch porn. Use your imagination if need be but avoid porn at all cost. I can’t stress this point enough. Realize that life works at a very slow pace. This sounds a lot easy but trust me, its way more difficult in practical. In the age of internet, we easily develop the habit of instant gratification. Want something to eat ? It’s just 2 clicks away. Wanna order clothes ? Just pick your phone and select from latest trends and this will cost you less than actually visiting the store or a restaurant, thanks to discounts. This creates a habit loop of EXPECTING everything INSTANTLY, which is the number one reason for stress. We just don’t realize that everything takes time, that dreams are not achieved by working overnight and this is why most people give up. So slow down, take a deep breath and slowly but constantly work towards your goal. In the pipelne.. edit coming soon ;) And never forget to enjoy life every chance you get. Realize that one day, not today, not tomorrow, but one day in distant future, probably in a galaxy far far away, you are going to die and everything will be for nothing. So work on yourself but make sure to enjoy in everything you pick to do in life. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 https://qr.ae/prXAE0","tags":["Quora文选","2022年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"What made you decide to be child free or to have children?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2022/11/24/2022/2022-11-24-What-made-you-decide-to-be-child-free-or-to-have-children/","content":"What made you decide to be child free or to have children?Dan Andersen 1.4M views · 4.4K upvotes My wife and I met, she was 20 I was 18.

These are among the best things I have ever learned: You spend your first 20 years worrying what people think about you. You spend your next 20 years swearing that you don’t care what people think about you. You spend the next 20 years realizing that they aren’t thinking about you. A liberation! Any day on this side of the dirt is a good day. Some people didn’t make the cut last night. I was hit by a speeding taxi as I was walking to a bus stop. I spent a month in rehab with two broken legs, a brain injury, multiple back injuries and other fractures. The night before I was hit, a young, married couple was also hit. They both died. Practice gratitude. A woman I know spends most of her time thinking about how much she hates her thighs. She can give you a detailed report on what is wrong with them. She forgets all the places those legs have taken her, all the miles they have walked for her. It doesn’t occur to her that when she gets up in the middle of the night to pee, those very thighs walk her to the toilet. Spend more time appreciating what you’ve got— a heart that beats, a way to pick up your cup of coffee, the eyes that see that cup and know what color it is. Blessings abound. There are two kinds of people in this world – those who believe there is enough to go around, and those who don’t. Here is an example: If Margo is leaning up against the car kissing her boyfriend, and I think how nice that must feel, do I try to steal Margo’s boyfriend or do I go out and get my own boyfriend? I go out and get myself a boyfriend. I don’t need to steal Margo’s. I know that there is enough to go around. An old Native American woman was asked why she was always so happy.

This woman looked at me weird, then started walking towards me (so she could go to the bus stop), she tripped over in her heels and collapsed on the floor, she was fine but her groceries fell out of her bag and her milk bottle was ruined. I then immediately got up, walked over and helped her up, then I started to pack her stuff into her bag, I asked if she was alright and she said she was fine. I then got the milk bottle and chucked it in the nearest bin, grabbed coins from my pocket and gave it to her to buy a new bottle of milk. She said she couldn’t take the money as it “felt wrong to take it” but she eventually accepted it and thanked me. She said goodbye and then she said “wait smile again, you look so beautiful and happy” “you remind me of myself back in the old days” and then walked away.

Leaving your hometown in your 20s is a life hack. Not all success is due to hard work, it can be due to smart work. The beliefs you have about yourself will determine how you treat yourself. Sometimes people don’t have the capacity to love us the way we need to be loved. Growth and change can feel uncomfortable. But, lack of growth and change can be detrimental. We may keep encountering the same lesson until we are ready to learn it. It’s normal. We gravitate towards the familiar because it gives us a false sense of safety. Most of us will choose a familiar pain over an unknown alternative. The deepest form of loneliness comes from being estranged from ourselves, not from others. Relationships are not just something we choose, they are something we build. Communication is not just about what we say, but also about how we say it. There is often an emphasis on us learning how to offer love, rarely are we taught how to receive it. Both skills are equally important for us to have. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 ▌评论: Marcus McNary:“Not all success is due to hard work, it can be due to smart work”.Trust funds, coming from a well connected, financially stable and comfortable home also helps. ▌词汇: detrimental: &#x2F;ˌdɛtrɪ’mɛntl&#x2F; causing harm or damage 有害的，不利的 estrange:尤用於被动语态~ sb (from sb) cause (sb formerly loving or friendly) to become unfriendly to sb 使（某人）疏远某人; 离间 https://qr.ae/pva9Zg","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What is true love？","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2022/10/03/2022/2022-10-03-what-is-true-love/","content":"What is true love？Gaia 911.5k Views · 18.1k Upvotes My parents were married for 55 years. One morning, my mom was going downstairs to make dad breakfast, she had a heart attack and fell. My father picked her up as best he could and almost dragged her into the truck. At full speed, without respecting traffic lights, he drove her to the hospital. When he arrived, unfortunately, she was no longer with us. During the funeral, my father did not speak; his gaze was lost. He hardly cried. That night, his children joined him. In an atmosphere of pain and nostalgia, we remembered beautiful anecdotes and he asked my brother, a theologian, to tell him where Mom would be at that moment. My brother began to talk about life after death, and guesses as to how and where she would be. My father listened carefully. Suddenly he asked us to take him to the cemetery. Dad!” we replied, “it’s 11 at night, we can’t go to the cemetery right now!” He raised his voice, and with a glazed look he said: “Don’t argue with me, please don’t argue with the man who just lost his wife of 55 years.” There was a moment of respectful silence, we didn’t argue anymore. We went to the cemetery, we asked the night watchman for permission. With a flashlight, we reached the tomb. My father caressed her, prayed, and told his children, who watched the scene moved: “It was 55 years… you know? No one can talk about true love if they have no idea what it’s like to share life with a woman.” He paused and wiped his face. “She and I, we were together in that crisis. I changed jobs …” he continued. “We packed up when we sold the house and moved out of town. We shared the joy of seeing our children finish their careers, we mourned the departure of loved ones side by side, we prayed together in the waiting room of some hospitals, we support each other in pain, we hug each Christmas, and we forgive our mistakes… Children, now it’s gone, and I’m happy, do you know why? Because she left before me. She didn’t have to go through the agony and pain of burying me, of being left alone after my departure. I will be the one to go through that, and I thank God. I love her so much that I wouldn’t have liked her to suffer…” When my father finished speaking, my brothers and I had tears streaming down our faces. We hugged him, and he comforted us, “It’s okay, we can go home, it’s been a good day.” That night I understood what true love is; It is far from romanticism, it does not have much to do with eroticism, or with sex, rather it is linked to work, to complement, to care and, above all, to the true love that two really committed people profess“.

There were some group projects we were doing. I can remember I got paired with an attractive brunette girl, short, 5′2, maybe 100 lbs, big mousey eyes, young, maybe 21 at most. And I can even remember her name still, Nicole. After our group project, where we got to know each other, she began sitting beside me every day in class. Even if I changed seats, she’d find me like a heat seeking missile. She’d lean over and whisper “Hey!” before plopping down next to me. Apparently my wedding ring was invisible. I’d often groan with this pain-pleasure feeling as she approached. It was as though God had sent this gorgeous archangel to tempt my faith in marriage. And, to be fair, I did enjoy talking to her. She was very nice, interesting, and well, damn-attractive. Getting married doesn’t turn you into an invincible Faith-Bot. Things sort of came to a head one day as we left class. As we stepped outside the doors, with other students filing out, she touched her hair and said: “Hey, do you think you could give me a ride home?” She winked after she said it with a big smile. I paused and felt my heart beating faster. And painnnnnfully said, ~“I….I really shouldn’t. ……I have to be somewhere in like 15 minutes. And I can’t be late.” I say “painfully” because that is me being honest. I was 100% faithful to my wife during our marriage. But to say there weren’t moments like this, would be disingenuous. In the split moment of Nicole’s veiled invitation, I saw this door in my mind. Going through that door, I saw this rush, all of this lusty imagery that I could partake in. It would have surely been great. For that moment. I knew, from having known guys who’d gone through that door, what happens next. And it isn’t pretty. Once that door is open, there is no closing it, no going back. You will keep going. And it will lead to a dark place. A dark place where things that can’t be undone will undo everything good in your life. In these situations, you need to use your head and think vividly about consequences, or those consequences will become your reality. Most importantly, you need to pay credence to the love and respect you have for your spouse.

My family is in from out of town. My parents are asleep in my guest room. My sister, who I almost never get to see, is asleep in my home office. My dog is probably curled up with my dad, happy as she can be because he’s her favorite human. We had a wonderful dinner tonight. My wife and I cooked. I grilled steaks and she made the sides. Dad told stories. Sister laughed. Mom rolled her eyes. Wife listened and smiled with unbridled joy; she didn’t have this growing up. We watched a fantastic movie. Ate ice cream. We took a walk at sunset around my neighborhood. I threw a football with my dad for a few minutes. Tomorrow, I get to see my grandparents and the rest of my extended family. My wife is asleep next to me. She’s pregnant with our first child. A girl. Doctor says she’s developed enough to hear now. She heard her grandfather’s roaring laughter tonight, a sound she’ll be all too familiar with before too long. I don’t have a large bank account. I don’t have a big house. We live a modest life.

Emily Payton, BSc Psychology (2021) 313.4K views · 1.8K upvotes Lazy people get out of bed, because staying in bed all day is boring. Lazy people shower, because being dirty is uncomfortable. Lazy people form connections with others, because social relationships are rewarding. Lazy people enjoy things. They enjoy food, or video games, or drinking, or masturbating, or smoking, or watching TV, or talking to friends on the phone all night. They have the capacity for excitement and happiness, even if the things that make them happy are 100% hedonistic. Lazy people are relaxed. They are not afraid to go outside, or get out of bed or see people. They do not have panic attacks. They don’t fear being awake, so they don’t sleep all day. The thought of working – or failing – does not terrify them. They don’t hide their face. They see the value in being alive, and appreciate the world they are living in. Lazy people generally don’t complain about hating themselves, or hating their life, or wanting to be better but being unable to do so – that’s too much effort for someone who is lazy. Someone who is lazy doesn’t care enough to think that way. I could see why a lazy person would lie about having depression to get out of doing something, but I doubt they would have the commitment to make it really convincing. Depression is not laziness. Sure, some of the behaviors are the same, and I can understand your confusion, but they actually look very different. Saying that depression is the same as laziness is a bit like saying cats are the same as dogs, because they’re both furry and have four legs.

We talked about other stuff too. He talked about his crush and asked about mine too to which I replied——Nikita. After that day, he started calling me after every 3–4 days and asked for explaining the topics he had problems with. I was more than happy to help him out as explaining him also helped me in my revision and strengthening of the topic and it’s concepts. We use to talk for about an hour after that and I use to tell him all I know about Nikita and he use to tell me about his crush. After 3 months, my best friend came to me and this conversation happened, He: Do you know that Nitin proposed to Nikita today!? Me: ……………………………. What……………………okay……..what! He: Yes, and Nikita accepted it too! Me: But how can she accept his proposal? He just proposed to her out of the blue and she accepted…..impossible! He: No, I heard that he has been talking to her for over 2 months now! I think the same time you started teaching him. He used all the things you told him about Nikita to woo her! Yep, that turned out to be very true! He backstabbed me and stole my crush!

She went to her fridge and said, “gee, I am out of milk.” Then she turned to me and said, “what just went through your head when I said that?” I responded, “I considered how I could get you some milk.” She said to me, “that’s right. You thought that because you are a woman. A man won’t think that way. He will hear it as a fact. FACT: NO MILK. He will not read more into it than that. If you want to have a happy marriage, never assume that he knew what you were hinting.“ She told me that I should be sure to clearly and kindly say, “honey we are out of milk, and it would make me very happy if you could grab some on the way home.” Her advice has proved very wise.

When my wife, Isabelle, and I moved to Asia, Isabelle insisted that we not have a live-in maid. I wanted one to make our lives easy. In the end, you can guess what happened - we didn’t get the maid. Instead, we’ve got a part-time maid who does the cleaning and laundry. Now, around a decade on, I really see the wisdom behind her insistence.

Why do women always date the worst kind of men? It’s so annoying.” Well, I have the answer. It’s because we were lied to. Our entire childhood was a lie. I remember that in pre-school, I was playing on the swing set of our school playground when suddenly, this boy named Liam (he was 4 years old) just walked over to me and pushed me off the swings without saying a WORD. He laughed and I just walked away. I had scratches all over my arms and legs and my face was covered with dirt. It was my first time getting physically bullied during school and I was on the verge of tears the rest of the day. When I walked home, I cried to my mom and explained the entire thing to her. And you know what she said? “Oh it’s okay, Tessa. He just has a crush on you.” And from that day on, I was taught from the ripe age of 4 years old to confuse violence and affection. And if you’re a woman, I’m guessing you were taught that too. If you weren’t, you’re lucky. Because resulting from that, I became attracted to abusive men. Is that my fault? No. Did I have to unlearn that? YES. But instead of complaining about why women like certain types of men, maybe you should teach your kids that men shouldn’t be treating women poorly. We need to hold those boys accountable for their actions. No more “boys will be boys” bullshit. And we need to teach women not to ignore this type of abuse at such a young age. It’s unacceptable.

Like “girls like jerks&#x2F;assholes” or “ignore her and she’ll want you more”. While in a limited number of cases these may be true, overall they seem like an ingenious attempt at explaining the ideas mentioned in the answer. I remember learning this myself. When I voluntarily acted like a jerk to my then girlfriend, she just said “asshole!” and we didn’t speak for a while. That was a lifelong lesson. Such a statement is probably an overcorrection of the whole “nice guy problem”, which, again, quite simply, is about the problem of expecting something from a woman just for being “nice” to her. And the ignoring part is just about not seeming (or actually not being) needy to the point of obsession. Everyone begins to feel smothered at some point, and it becomes rather uncomfortable. It really goes for both parties. Relying on the other person for personal fulfillment rather than actually having a life and goals makes the relationship tasteless and redundant. Anyway, thanks for a good answer. ▌词汇: turn sb. off: to make someone feel that they are not attracted to you in a sexual way使丧失性兴趣，反义词: turn on ingenious: &#x2F;ɪn’dʒinɪəs&#x2F; an ingenious plan, idea, or object works well and is the result of clever thinking and new ideas〔计划、主意或物体〕精巧的，巧妙的 https://qr.ae/pGdSAr","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"Why, when parents argue in front of a young child, does the child seem to favor the aggressor","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2022/03/07/2022/2022-03-07-Why-when-parents-argue-in-front-of-a-young-child-does-the-child-seem-to-favor-the-aggressor/","content":"Why, when parents argue in front of a young child, does the child seem to favor the aggressorDiane Cavaness, I taught middle school science for 37 years 1M views · 9.8KUpvotes 1964, I’m 8, my brothers are 6 and 10.

Franklin knew that it would be beneficial to have this man on his side, but instead of groveling for his approval, he took a counter-intuitive approach. He knew his rival was in possession of a very rare and valuable book, and simply asked him to borrow it. After a few days, he returned it with a thank you note and, surprisingly, his rival became his friend. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 What Franklin tapped into is a well-known psychological principle known as cognitive dissonance. Basically, cognitive dissonance is the tension that results from having two contradictory beliefs in our mind at the same time. This stress is uncomfortable, so we automatically alter one of our beliefs to conform with the other to resolve this conflict. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 In the case of Franklin, his rival held the belief: “I do not like Benjamin Franklin.” Upon doing him the favor, however, he was forced to come to terms with another belief: “It’s a pain in the ass to do favors for other people, so I only do favors for people I like.” These two beliefs are in conflict, and since he cannot un-loan the book, he was forced to soften and eventually reverse his ill-will towards Franklin. The secret of the Benjamin Franklin effect is this: If you want people to like you, ask them to do favors for you. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 ▌评论: Feifei Wang I remember a similar experiment: Two group of people are asked to participate an activity.

I was in elementary school at the time. The boy’s family lived in an enormous mansion. It was grand. It was glorious. Every nook and cranny of that building seemed to exude power, wealth, success. Walking up to the main door, I was utterly in awe of the size of… everything. Then I went inside. And it was… empty. Not literally empty, there were chairs, sofas, the largest television set I had ever seen and some lamps. But the house had no books. The house had few pictures. And there were no parents to be seen. I asked were my friends’ father was? At work, the answer went. He was always at work. His mother was “sick”, on bed with a headache. Every time I was there, and I was there five or six times, dad was away at work, mom was sick with a headache. Looking back I’m almost certain the woman was an alcoholic. The man a workaholic. My friend was raised more or less by his older siblings. Our house was small. Our families deeply involved. Life was simple… but it felt full. Theirs, though outwardly grand, felt empty.

But full. So many items, so many photos, so many artifacts, each with their own unique story.

After we left to walk back, I glanced at the bill and realized that it was way too low. The cashier had scanned everything in front of us - we heard the beeps and tones, etc., but many items just had not made it to the total. As I recall, we had been undercharged about 30% to 40%. We walked back and spoke to the manager. After he realized that we were not complaining about being overcharged or that the cashier was making errors (we were very clear about that!), he went over the register and realized that it wasn’t working properly. I guess many people had paid less than they should have - certainly that day! He shut the register down, thanked us, and waved us out!

I was in 2nd grade. My mom decided to get me a flip phone through Tracfone to text her if my blood sugar drops or if the nurse doesn’t show up to give me my insulin dose. Every other year after that I got a new Tracfone for Christmas. When I turned 12 or 13, I asked my mom for a newer, better phone. I had just moved to the high school (7th-12th grade) and everyone else had nice iPhones. I knew my mom couldn’t afford an iPhone so I searched eBay for any phone that would do more than a cheap Tracfone. At my school, teachers allow students to use a phone to search things, take pictures of dissections or powerpoints, or do our online assignments. I wanted to be able to be like everyone else and not have to go to get a teacher to unlock the room to the laptops to be able to do what others do or have to use a dictionary and have homework because it took too long to find the definitions. I found a cheap android phone by the company Blu and my mom bought it for me. I loved it. My mom couldn’t afford data so I used the school’s WiFi. About 2 years later, I wanted an iPhone. I got bullied for being poor and having a phone that became slow and was considered cheap. My mom got me a refurbished iPhone 6s Plus for Christmas 2016. I’m still using this phone and I love it. Yes, I’d LOVE to have the newest iPhone but I’m very thankful to have this phone. My family hasn’t had an income for 4 years yet my mom figured out a way to get me a better phone that would last a while. I’m NOT telling you that this is what you should do. What I’m saying is ask her why she thinks she needs an iPhone. Ask her why she feels that way. Try to compromise with her. But hear her out. Teenagers often feel as if their feelings are invalid and that we don’t have good points. Have a conversation, don’t yell or raise your voice or have an attitude that screams “I’m better than you and only my points and views are valid”.

Learning. Discovering. 357.7k Views · 12.3k Upvotes A big, big thank you to my ex for showering me with these beautiful pieces of advice. Never date someone you’re not attracted to. If you’re confused, it’s a NO. Never date someone who has recently come out of a break-up. He&#x2F;She might be on a rebound. In fact, in most of the cases, they are. Never date someone who’s not emotionally strong as you. You’ll be the one to suffer. Don’t rush things. Rushing things will only lead to more complications. Start slow. Discover each other. If your partner has lied to you on small things, he&#x2F;she is capable of lying to you on more big things as well. Immediately leave them. Lack of communication destroys a relationship. Always communicate about your problems with your partner. Try to sort them out. And lastly, don’t confuse lust with love. Peace ▌评论: Neil Barembaum:I would add two more, just as basic as these. Never date someone who is with someone else, even if they are willing to leave them for you — especially if they leave them for you. If they leave them for you, they will leave you for the next person.Never date someone because you think it is your last chance. There will always be another. https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-best-relationship-advice-you-ever-got/answer/Zeeshan-Mushtaq-5","tags":["Quora文选","2022年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"What is one thing you just don't understand?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2022/01/30/2022/2022-01-30-What-is-one-thing-you-just-dont-understand/","content":"What is one thing you just don’t understand?Farrukh Shaikh, Nov 30 319.7k Views · 39.2k Upvotes What a broad thinking a Mother has for her neighbors!… Salute to her for kind Heart she has…👍 Everybody should help people around them; so this world could become a better place for all… 🙂 ▌评论: Leyit Dagyeng:I would do something similar in school.

My wife has had medical problems that have caused her to lose her figure. She is now very thin and wrinkled, and in the past year she’s lost all her teeth. She has dentures but usually won’t wear them when she’s at home. We’ve been together for just short of 41 years now. Anyway, one day she was sitting on the couch folding clothes, so I sat down on the couch next to her and gathered her in my arms. That beautiful ( though toothless) smile was still there, as was the light in her eyes that has never dimmed. And I held her and realized, “my God I will always love this woman”. And above all, in those eyes I saw that she feels the same about old, arthritic and wrinkled me. ▌评论: Ken Simpson:In my basement, I have a small metal lockable box. The kind that is typically used to keep cash in at garage sales. In that box is a picture of my wife. She was 20 years old and worked in a supermarket. Back then cashiers wore white uniforms, similar to a nurse’s outfit. Anyhow, she is just standing, smiling, in her white dress. That’s all. No sexy. Just standing, and smiling.

If you have 10 lakhs and are thinking about purchasing of a Car , go for purchasing agricuture land in near by small village instead. Instead of purchasing Car ,go for Cab, mostly it costs less than maintainace fee of Car per Month. If your sister wants to study further, let her please. Dont depend tooo much on your spouse. Household chores is basic thing , every body should learn and do. Do have Driving License. Invest in Liquid funds which you can get liquadated in urgency easily. Government job is not compulsory. Dont take Relatives so seriously , the demotivating relatives are passing clouds. Love making is different from having Sex, if your partner forced to have sex before Marriage Dont accept if you are not ready emotionally. Take a journey with yourself to New places. Show emotional attachements to only very very closed ones. Dont make other people to accept your past, you are right at that situations in your own way. You are not tooo old. At this stage , most of the parents get Health issues , take Health Insurance. If you are not satisfied with your Job, try to do online Business ( Flipkart, Amazon ) by selling local products which is famous in your Home town.

So many boys who wanna be our “friend” aren’t actually looking for friendship but hoping for something more. It feels kinda shitty.

I didn’t want to fall into the trap that so many guys fall into of just trying to date the hottest possible woman with no regard for other factors. Looks surely matter and she’s beautiful—but she has other things going on too. She’s an archaeology professor at USF, with a focus on digital archaeology, so she is scanning artifacts and various cool things. She spent years living on excavations in Europe and Turkey (her focus is Bronze Age Archaeology). Like most people with a Ph.D., she’s super motivated, smart, and fun to talk to. If you haven’t noticed, I have an eclectic set of interests and consume a lot of information. In the past, I’ve had girlfriends roll their eyes and call me a weirdo when I start talking about goofy niche topics (things I write about here on Quora). Unsurprisingly, she doesn’t roll her eyes. Her name is Laura. We collaborate a lot on life and work decisions. She’s an editor for several academic journals so she’s always great at giving me feedback about my stuff. She’s not afraid to tell me when my writing sucks and needs work. It makes me better at what I do. I got lucky. ▌评论: Indicus:I’m not going to focus on the fact that both of you are good-looking as that’s bloody obvious.

Your ex belongs to your past, move on. Never hope on marrying someone when almost 70% of their family members don’t like you. The probability of the marriage not lasting is very high and you’re probably not going to enjoy the relationship. There is a distinct difference between dating for love and dating for sex. Always understand the main reason why you’re venturing into a relationship. Never fall in love when you are lonely, the consequences are going to be a harsh one. As long as it is still a relationship, never reveal your full potential or secrets to whoever you are dating. Your personal development should come first before relationships. People who you are in relationships with can still leave you but you can never leave yourself, meaning never compromise your adventures and dreams for anyone. Avoid relationships that seems to be too good to be true at the beginning. When the other person is rushing things too fast, don’t get carried away with romance and sex. Slow down and be careful because this is how people get hooked on to narcissistic partners. Never date someone that gives commands and doesn’t respect you. The probability of emotional abuse is very high. Never date anybody that doesn’t know how to give but knows only how to take. Never date anyone with the mindset of changing their character, attitude, and behaviors. Remember, you can never raise an adult! ▌评论: Cyrus Lapie:Never get into a romantic relationship when you don’t have work or enough money to sustain a family of at least four.

Then you look in the mirror and realize they say that about you, too. Your mind is as sharp as ever, and you feel like you have learned a few things, too, maybe even a bit of wisdom. But you feel more aches and pains. You don’t recover from hard work as quickly. I developed inflammatory arthritis at 27 which turned me into an 88 year old, so I suppose my experience may be unique. You have noticed that women age better than men. And that includes you. You consider how long it took to get to 45, and if you make it to 90, then you get to redo all you have already experienced—the glass is indeed only half empty. You are too old to be a sports star, but very young for a politician. You take care of children while caring for ailing parents. It is a very stressful time. Very stressful. And if your parents are gone, you grieve them. You even miss the hard times and would like them back because you still were a son or daughter. Now you’re just a parent. Or not. You no longer can use youth as an excuse for doing dumb shit. But you are probably not interested in doing crazy shit anymore, either. Why? Because you are 45. ▌评论: Chris Fernandez-Packham:How well people age is down to genetics, diet, lifestyle and presentation. Frankly most men make little too no effort on their appearance and look dreadful when they don’t need to. Often middle aged guys dress badly, neglect skin care and hygiene, and are either lazy or immature. They create their own problems in that regard. But since most men aren’t as judged on their appearance as women, they aren’t as incentivised. Plus men in manual labour work in harsh conditions that prematurely age them. ▌词汇: inflammatory: &#x2F;ɪn’flæmə’tɔri&#x2F; an inflammatory disease or medical condition causes inflammation 引发炎症的 arthritis: &#x2F;ɑr’θraɪtɪs&#x2F; a disease that causes the joints of your body to become swollen and very painful 关节炎 ailing: &#x2F;‘elɪŋ&#x2F; ill and not likely to get better 生病的，身患痼疾的 https://qr.ae/pGEHPz","tags":["Quora文选","2022年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"What was the best piece of relationship advice you were given by your parents or another adult?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2021/08/22/2021/2021-08-22-What-was-the-best-piece-of-relationship-advice-you-were-given-by-your-parents-or-another-adult/","content":"What was the best piece of relationship advice you were given by your parents or another adult?Dushka Zapata, I also write about life on Instagram 109.6k Views · 8.2k Upvotes One afternoon a long time ago (we must have been around fourteen years old) a friend of mine was talking to his dad. “I am in love with a girl” he said, “and I’d like to know how to keep her by my side.” “You can’t” his dad said. “You can’t keep her.

In the second week he called the children over again: “Children, my money is scarce, I can only give you fifty pence, not a pound.” Now three weeks had passed and the old man called the children over to him for the last time: “Children, unfortunately I have no money, so I can’t give you any more.” The children: “No money, no noise” and so they stopped rubbing the sticks on the balcony railing. ▌评论: ΛΝDΞRONΞ:Knowing me as a kid I would have responded with, “no problem sir, I’ll make the sound for free.” ▌翻译: 当孩子们在放学回家的路上经过一栋老房子时，他们总是用棍子在阳台的栏杆上摩擦，他们很享受这声音。年长的主人被这种声音困扰了很久，后来他想到一个非常好的主意来结束这个事儿，他的方法却不是责骂孩子们。 他把孩子们叫到他身边，”孩子们，你们发出的声音非常好听，如果你们继续这样的话，我每天给你们一英镑”，孩子们孩子继续，于是他每天给孩子们一英镑。 在第二个星期，他又把孩子们叫了过来，说：”孩子们，我的钱不多了，我只能给你们50便士，不能给你们一英镑了。” 现在三个星期过去了，老人最后一次把孩子们叫到他身边，说：”孩子们，不幸的是我现在没钱了，所以我不能再给你们了，谢谢你们给我带来的声音。” 孩子们说：”没钱，就没有声音”，于是他们就再也没在阳台栏杆上摩擦过木棍。 ▌词汇: railing: a metal fence that is made of a series of upright bars 围栏，栏杆","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"2020年12月(微信)文章汇总","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2020/12/31/2020/2020年12月文章汇总/","content":"2020年12月 Quora高赞 | 学习的终极目的是什么？这是我读过的最好的回答 “You name it.”的意思可不是让你取个名字 别人问你“好吃吗？”的时候到底是什么意思？| 歪解 推荐一款比微信截图好用N多倍的截图软件 | 神器 Quora | 在中国他们都会这样做，却从不说“我爱你” “family”是家庭，”immediate family”是什么意思？ 这款搜书神器，覆盖全网电子书，承包你的书单 Quora | 为什么生活如此艰辛？ “boys will be boys”，用这句形容男孩子最贴切 Quora | 30岁前必须要做的10件事情有哪些？ 【软件分享】秒开PDF，这款不到5M的神级阅读器值得收藏 Quora | 你的另一半儿给过你哪些惊喜？ 火爆Tik Tok的”today years old”，并不是在说几岁了 推荐一款看美剧学单词的APP！ Quora | 真正幸福的情侣间都有哪些习惯？ Quora | 世纪难题：老妈和老婆掉水里，先救谁？ 好用到爆的布尔运算在PPT中怎么用？ Quora | 许多优秀的人选择单身的真正理由是什么？ 10件25岁之后才会明白的事，满足任何一件，都说明你真的是个大人了 “I wasn’t born yesterday.”不能直译成我昨天才出生！ Quora | 什么样的人不会成功？ 推荐3个宝藏英语学习小程序！ “You’re telling me!”不要翻译成你在教我做事啊 2020年11月 Quora | 有哪些价值10万赞的照片？ 高校寒假时间公布！(附相关词汇) “Tell me about it.”，千万别翻译成快告诉我吧 Quora | 你有哪些瞒着父母的小秘密？结局令人感动 Quora | 成功的定义是什么？ 不用第三方软件，教你用PPT制作二维码 Quora | 一个有趣的小故事：谁才是真正的强盗？！ 数学不会就是不会 “stand up”是站起来，”stand sb up”是什么意思？ Quora | 关于拜登你知道哪些别人不知道的事儿？川普不可能有这经历 分享4个英文阅读APP “call”是打电话，”a close call”是什么意思？跟电话可没关系 Quora | 真正幸福的情侣间都有哪些习惯？ “love handles”是身体哪个部位？你最想减掉它 Quora | 作为一个中国人是一种什么样的体验？ 她说“你是个好人”到底是什么意思？ “on cloud nine”是说要上天吗？ Quora | 你后悔为拜登投票吗？美国网友这样评价川普 一辈子做到这3件事就足够了！ “put on”是穿上，”put 10 years on”是什么意思 Quora | 人民日报点赞了这条回答：你去过的哪个国家和描述的完全不一样？China！ “Break a leg!” 可不是“打断腿”的意思，而是在祝福你！ Quora | 你还在和你约会过的第一个人保持联系吗？ “You don’t say”，可不是让你闭嘴，千万别误会！ Quora | 一生中最该做的10件事是什么？ Quora | 哪些图能定义什么才是真爱？ “You can say that again”，不是你再说一个试试，而是在夸你！ Quora | 为什么大多数的人的梦想都没成真？ 什么才是真正的朋友？ Quora | 晚上应该养成哪些好习惯？ Boys will be boys! 男人都这样吗？！ Quora | 当年火爆QQ空间的一篇文章英文版：当我从11楼跳下…… 表达No！这10个句子教你如何优雅地拒绝别人 2020年10月 Quora | 有哪些真实故事证明这个世界并不公平？ Quora | 什么才是真正的成熟？ 真正的强者不需要向每个人都证明自己~ Quora | 有哪些最触动人心的小故事？ Quora | 这世上最好和最坏的感觉是什么？ Quora | 真正成熟的爱情是什么样的？ 一个结果惊人且有趣的英语小测试！ Quora | 一个有趣的小故事：喜欢的人不喜欢我，我很痛苦，该怎么办？ 表达”赞同”除了说Ok之外，还有这30种说法 Quora | 维持长久婚姻的真相是什么？ 「神器推荐」告别百度文库，这款阅读器帮你免费下载任何文档 Quora | 老外奇葩提问“中国有电脑吗？” 中国网友的机智回答 Quora | 你有哪些好的建议要送给一个20多岁的人？ Quora | 有哪些大多数人没听说过的新发明？把人逼疯的验证码原来还在做这么有意义的事儿 . 这篇教你打出朋友圈的这种特殊字体！ Quora | 晚上应该养成哪些好习惯？ 外国人问「How are you?」时到底应如何回答？ Quora | 随着年龄的增长，才发现这些道理都太对了！你能做到几条？ 好消息！2021初会考生备考指南来啦，轻松高分上岸！ Quora | 你听过最好的恋爱建议是什么?

I worked there for one year, and to my own surprise, I saved my entire salary. Not for one month, but for one whole year. No exception, every single penny saved, suppressing all the urges to buy anything for myself for one whole year. And at the end of one year, I had 804$ in my account. Using which, I bought a couch and a dining table to my home, which was a long time dream of my mom. That was a moment when I watched my dad helping the truck driver to carry the furniture inside, and my mom are excited. And that’s when I had this epiphany Damn I grew up :) ▌翻译: 你在哪一刻突然感觉自己长大了？ 我的第一份工作是学校老师，工资待遇是每月67美元。我在那里工作了一年，令我自己都感到惊讶的是我把自己的工资全部都存了起来。不是一个月的，而是整整一年的。无一例外，每一分钱都存了下来，整整一年的时间里我压制住了自己买任何东西的冲动。 那一年结束时我的账户里有804美元。用这些钱我给家里买了一张沙发和一张餐桌，这是我妈妈长久以来的梦想。那一刻，我看着爸爸帮着卡车司机把家具搬进屋里，妈妈都很兴奋。 这时我才顿悟，我真的长大了：) ▌词汇: urge: a strong wish or need强烈的欲望; 迫切的要求; 冲动 （urge to do sth）He could no longer resist the urge to go and see Amanda. 他再也抗拒不了去看阿曼达的强烈欲望。 epiphany: a Christian holy day on January 6th that celebrates the day when the Three Kings came to see the baby Jesus〔基督教 1 月 6 日的〕主显节〔为纪念三博士拜见圣婴耶稣的节日〕","tags":["Quora文选","2020年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"Why do we need to study?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2020/12/15/2020/2020-12-15-Why-do-we-need-to-study/","content":"Why do we need to study?Rajan Singh, CEO ConceptOwl, Ex-IPS, IITian, Wharton MBA 180.2k Views · 15.1k Upvotes Two months ago, I asked a bunch of class 10th kids in a Trivandrum school: “Why do we have to study Quadratic(二次的) equations and all this Maths you are going through? Your parents also studied these things, but are they using it?“ You must have seen the delight in the students’ eyes that someone finally asked this question! Some of them said, “Yes sir, we also wonder why all it is needed. But it is in the syllabus(教学大纲) - so we have to study.” Here is what I told them. “When you go to a gym, you lift weights or do biceps curls(二头肌蜷曲), bench press(卧推), or things like that. Why do you do that? In real life, how often do you have to do a biceps curl like movement to lift something? The reason we do these exercises is to build our strength and stamina so that we can respond to any situation where we need physical strength. Even more importantly, it improves our overall health parameters and quality of life. Similarly, the reason we study maths or any other subject is that they help build our mental muscle, develop logical thinking, and help us make sense of the world by recognizing patterns. By studying, we are able to build mental models about the world, so that we can respond to situations more smartly than a monkey or an ape(大猩猩) would do.” That, in a nutshell, is my answer to this question. I also hope that we encourage our children to ask more of these questions and engage them in a meaningful discussion so that we produce thinking citizens, and not compliant robots. ▌词汇: quadratic：&#x2F;kwɑˈdrætɪk&#x2F; (adj.) 二次的；(n.) 二次方程式； syllabus：&#x2F;‘sɪləbəs&#x2F; (n.) (pl ~es) list of subjects, topics, texts, etc included in a course of study 教学大纲: ‘Hamlet’ is on this year’s English literature syllabus. 《哈姆雷特》是本学年英国文学教学大纲中规定的作品。 biceps：&#x2F;‘baɪsɛps&#x2F; (n.) (pl unchanged 复数不变) large muscle at the front of the upper arm, which bends the elbow 二头肌: His biceps is&#x2F;are impressive. 他臂力过人。 stamina：&#x2F;‘stæmɪnə&#x2F; (n.) ability to endure much physical or mental strain; long-lasting energy and resilience; staying-power 精力; 耐力; 韧劲: Marathon runners need plenty of stamina. 参加马拉松长跑要有耐力。 nutshell：(n.) 概括 You know, that’s it in a nutshell. 那是对我最好的概括。 compliant：(adj.) ~ (withsb&#x2F;sth) (usu derog 通常作贬义) (too) willing to comply (with other people, with rules, etc) （对於他人﹑ 规章等）（过於）顺从的, 百依百顺的, 惟命是听的。 ▌翻译: 我们为什么要学习？ 两个月前，我在特里凡得琅的一所学校里问了一群10年级的孩子， “为什么我们要学习二次方程和你们正在学习的所有这些数学知识? 你们的父母也学过这些东西，但他们现在用得着这些东西吗？” 学生们眼中满是喜悦，终于有人提出这个问题了！ 他们有的说：”是的先生，我们也很奇怪为什么要学这些东西。但这些都在教学大纲中，所以我们必须得学习。” 如下是我告诉他们的： “当你去健身房的时候，你会举重或做肱二头肌卷曲、卧推或类似的事情。你为什么要这样做呢？在现实生活中，你有多少次要做肱二头肌卷曲这样的动作才能举起东西？ 我们做这些运动的原因是为了增强我们的力量和耐力，以便我们能够应对任何需要体力的情况。更重要的是，它能提高我们的整体的健康水平和生活质量。 同样，我们学习数学或任何其他科目的原因是它们有助于锻炼我们的逻辑思维，并帮助我们通过识认识事物的运行模式来理解这个世界。 通过学习，我们能够建立世界的模型，这样我们就能比猴子或大猩猩更聪明地应对出现在生活里的各种情况。” 简而言之，以上就是我对这个问题的回答。 我还希望我们能鼓励孩子们提出更多的这类问题，让他们参与更有意义的讨论中来，以便我们能培养出有思想的学生，而不是言听计从的机器人。","tags":["Quora文选","2020年","🎨精选"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What is a waste of time?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2020/12/15/2020/2020-12-15-What-is-a-waste-of-time/","content":"What is a waste of time?Chetan Ghodeswar, Government College of Engineering, Jalgaon (2019) 104.4k Views · 3.6k Upvotes Love is a waste of time.

Young love can last. Love is the one thing you should put all your energy into, or most. I’m talking self love, family love, couple love, stranger love. It is the foundation of Human nature. It’s the misconception that it’s a waste time that makes it fleeting for most. If you know the true meaning of love then you know it is of the utmost important. Gurmeet Singh： In some cases maturity not comes with age. It comes with incident. Maturity is core element for successful love. Here I am talking about mental maturity. ▌词汇: misconception: an idea which is wrong or untrue, but which people believe because they do not understand the subject properly 错误想法，误解; 错误印象 fleeting: lasting for only a short time 短暂的，飞逝的 ▌翻译: 哪些事情最浪费时间？ 恋爱是一种浪费时间的行为。特别是如果你在22岁之前谈恋爱，那就是浪费时间。（见评论区） 只是和朋友谈论你的或者他迷恋的对象（却什么也不做）是浪费时间。 过分担心未来是浪费时间。 给别人提建议是浪费时间。没有人会听从你的建议，人们只做他们想做的事。 盯着女孩看是浪费时间。 看别人的WhatsApp状态更新是浪费时间，最好的办法是给它静音。 辩论或争论（辩论总是变成争论）政治是浪费时间。 浏览Ins和Facebook页面浪费时间。 每一次大学里的讲座都去参加，这是在浪费时间。 所以，如果你喜欢这个答案，那就点赞吧，点赞并不浪费时间。 Tulip Brady： 除了第一条，其他的我都同意。爱情是人生中唯一绝对不会浪费时间的事情，年轻时候的爱情是可以长久的。爱情是你应该投入所有精力的一件事，或者说是最重要的一件事。我说的是自爱，对家庭的爱，夫妻之间的爱，对陌生人的爱。它是人性的基础。对大多数人来说，正是因为误以为它是在浪费时间，所以它才会昙花一现。如果你知道爱的真谛，那么你就知道它才生命中是最重要的。 Gurmeet Singh： 在某些情况下，成熟不是看年龄而是看你经历过多少事情。成熟是成功爱情的核心要素，这里我说的是心理上的成熟。","tags":["Quora文选","2020年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"In Chinese culture, how common is it to regularly say, \"I love you\" to family?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2020/12/13/2020/2020-12-13-In-Chinese-culture,-how-common-is-it-to-regularly-say-I-love-you-to-family-and-significant-others/","content":"In Chinese culture, how common is it to regularly say, “I love you” to family?Dakota Lim, Updated February 29, 2016 289.9k Views · 1.8k Upvotes Very common to hear parents say “I love you” in the Chinese culture. BUT, these words must be translated. Here is the Chinese to English translation of“I love you”: Words“Have you eaten today?”“ate!”“Eat some more!”“Have this soup it will build strong blood.” ActionsMothers will give the best pieces of meat to their children. Parents whose children are studying at universities will wonder and worry if their children are healthy or coming down with a cold or flu. They will make phone calls to ask their children if they are having enough to eat. Mothers will receive hand-me-down children’s clothing from friends and relatives and will take them apart and sew them into astonishing clothing that their children will like wearing. Parents will continue to wear broken down shoes and slippers so their children can have shoes that fit well to wear to school so their feet won’t hurt while studying. If you tell Chinese parents your friends don’t have enough money to eat they will say, “Bring them home for dinner, I will make good soup for them.” And will place the best pieces of meat on their plates just as they do for their own children. They will make deep sacrifices to pay for books, school supplies, and tuition so their children will be able to have a safe and flourishing future through education. (Can you see the vision that comes from their heart?) Parents even express their love openly when introducing their children to people. The tone of their voice says, “I love you” when they say, “He&#x2F;she is my son&#x2F;daughter, he&#x2F;she went to XXX college.” The pride in their voices say, “I love them so much, they are my life. I live for them.“ Can you feel their love? ▌翻译: 中国父母会轻易说出“我爱你”吗？ 在中国文化中，经常听到父母说 “我爱你”，但是这三个字都是藏着这些话里：“你今天吃饭了吗？”“吃了！”“多吃点！”“多喝这个汤，可以补血” 父母的行为 母亲会把最好的肉片留给孩子吃。 子女在大学读书的父母经常会担心自己的孩子是否健康、是否感冒了，他们会打电话询问孩子在外面是否吃得饱。 妈妈们会收到亲朋好友送来的旧衣服，她们有时候会把这些衣服拆开再缝成孩子们喜欢穿的好看的衣服。 有些家长会继续穿破旧的鞋，好让他们的孩子在学校里能穿一双合脚的鞋子，让孩子在学习的时候脚不疼。 如果你告诉父母，你的朋友没有钱吃饭，他们会说：”带他们回家吃饭吧，我会给他们煲好汤”，并且会把最好的肉块放在他们的盘子里，就像给自己的孩子吃一样。 他们会做出挺大的牺牲来支付书本、学习用品和学费，让他们的孩子能够通过教育拥有一个辉煌的未来。 父母甚至在向人们介绍自己的孩子时会公开表达自己的爱心。当他们说：”他&#x2F;她是我的儿子&#x2F;女儿，他&#x2F;她上了XXX大学 “的时候，他们的语气就是在说“我爱你，我很骄傲”，他们语气中的自豪感是在表达“我很爱他们，他们是我的生命。我为他们而活。” 你能感受到他们的爱吗？ ▌词汇: hand-me-down: a piece of clothing which has been used by someone and then given to another person〔某人穿过传给别人的〕旧衣服: She refused to wear hand-me-downs.她不愿意穿别人穿过的旧衣服。 slipper: a light soft shoe that you wear at home 室内便鞋，拖鞋 https://www.quora.com/In-Chinese-culture-how-common-is-it-to-regularly-say-I-love-you-to-family-and-significant-others?top_ans=15046897","tags":["Quora文选","2020年","🎨精选"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What kind of people will not succeed in life?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2020/11/25/2020/2020-11-25-What-kind-of-people-will-not-succeed-in-life/","content":"What kind of people will not succeed in life?Akram Khan, lived in 10 Countries and Travelled to 35 427.8k Views · 32.3k Upvotes Some intelligent minds have quoted tons of valuable information under this question. Therefore, I would like to go the different way. What kind of people will not succeed in life? Well, as an answer to this question, I would say: Once there was an old blacksmith who was famous for making the best swords in the country. The soldiers came to him from different cities, even from distant borders and he made magnificent weapons for all of them. And the buyers, then boasted of their military achievements - everyone was returning from campaigns with success. One day a young guy came to him and said: - Master, please, make the best sword in the world, I want to go on campaign with King. Can you make it? - Sure, I can but it will take 1 year to make it - 1 year is too long - But you have to wait, otherwise, it won’t be the best sword in the world. The young guy agreed to come after a year. The blacksmith said, “Meanwhile, you must learn war skills from a reputed master”. The young man returned after a year. Blacksmith handed him his sword. During the war, this man showed high war skills and conquered all of his targets. After sometime, he returned to the blacksmith to say thanks for the best sword. Blacksmith said, “It’s not the sword that won the battles. It’s your fighting skills. You could do this with any other sword as well. I made this sword in just 2 days but I wanted you to learn extraordinary war skills, that’s why I told you to come after a year” What kind of people will not succeed? The one who doesn’t know, what he&#x2F;she needs for success. The one, who, instead of learning the required skills, focuses on proving his&#x2F;her (fake) success to others, probably won’t succeed. The one, who, continuously thinks, if I were handsome or if I were tall or if I were born in White-house or if my father were a businessman, then I would have, for sure, been a badass successful person on this planet, Probably, won’t succeed. If one spends sufficient time in learning, and never gives up, whatever, the conditions will be, I bet, no one can stop him&#x2F;her from becoming successful. Good luck! ▌翻译: 什么样的人不会成功？ 我想讲个故事作为这个问题的答案： 从前有一个老铁匠，他以制造全国最好的剑而闻名于世，士兵们从不同的城市，甚至从遥远的边境来找他，他都为他们制作了锋利的武器。而买主们，逢人都会夸耀自己的军功，因为他们每个人都是身负战功归来。 有一天，一个年轻人来找他，说： -大师，请你做一把世界上最好的剑，我想和国王一起出征，你能做出来吗？ -当然可以，不过要花一年的时间来做。 -1年太久了。 -但你一定得等，否则，就不是世上最好的剑了。 小伙子答应一年后再来。 铁匠说：”在这期间，你必须向一位有名望的师傅学习战术。” 年轻人一年后回到铁匠这里，铁匠把剑交给他。在接下来的许多场战争中，这个人表现出很高的战术，打败了他所有的敌人。过了一段时间，他回到铁匠那里，感谢铁匠给了他一把世上最好的剑。 铁匠说：”帮你赢得战斗的不是这把剑，而是你的战术，你用别的剑照样可以做到这一点。这把剑我只用了两天时间就打造出来了，但我想让你学会非凡的战术，所以我才告诉你让你一年后再来取剑。” 什么样的人不会成功？ 一个不知道为了成功需要什么的人不会成功； 一个只想证明Ta那伪成功给别人而不去学习真正技术的人可能不会成功； 一个不断地假想如果我很帅、如果我很高、如果我出生在白宫或者如果我爸是个商人的话那么我一定会成为这地球上非常成功的人，这种人可能不会成功。 如果一个人花足够的时间去学习，并且永不放弃，无论什么情况下，我敢打赌，没有人能阻止他的成功。 祝你成功！ ▌词汇: blacksmith: (also smith) (n.) person whose job is to make and repair things made of iron, esp horseshoes 铁匠（尤指马蹄铁匠）； boast: ~ (about&#x2F;of sth) talk (about one’s own achievements, abilities, etc) with too much pride and satisfaction 自夸; 自吹自擂: He’s always boasting about his children’s success at school. 他总是夸耀他的孩子们学习成绩好。 campaign: &#x2F;kæm’pen&#x2F; (n.) series of military operations with a particular aim, usu in one area 战役: He fought in the N African campaign during the last war. 在上次战争中他在北非战役参战。| series of planned activities with a particular social, commercial or political aim 运动（为某一社会的、商业的或政治的目的而进行的一系列有计划的活动）: a campaign against nuclear weapons 反对核武器运动； reputed: &#x2F;rɪ’pjutɪd&#x2F; (adj.)

The money belongs to the State. Your life belongs to you.” Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. This is called “Mind Changing Concept“. Changing the conventional way of thinking. When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her: “Please be civilized! This is a robbery and not a rape!” This is called “Being Professional“, Focus only on what you are trained to do! When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA-trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school): “Big brother, let’s count how much we got.” The older robber rebutted and said: “You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!” This is called “Experience“, Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: “Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank”. This is called “Swim with the tide“, Converting an unfavorable situation to your advantage! The supervisor says: “It will be good if there is a robbery every month.” This is called “Killing Boredom“, Personal Happiness is more important than your job. The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. The robbers were very angry and complained: “We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!” This is called “Knowledge is worth as much as gold!“ The bank manager was smiling and happy because his losses in the share market are now covered by this robbery. This is called “Seizing the opportunity“ Daring to take risks! So who are the real robbers here? 展开翻译 【全文翻译】在美国的一次抢劫案中，银行劫匪对着银行里的所有人大喊：\"不要动，钱是国家的，你们的命可是你们自己的。\"银行里的所有人都安静地躺下了。 这就是所谓的 \"思想观念改变的概念\"，所以你得改变传统的思维方式。 当一位女士很有挑逗性地躺在桌子上时，劫匪对她大喊：\"请你躺文明一点！这是抢劫，不是强奸!\" 这就是所谓的 \"专业\"，所以你应该只专注于自己所受培训的那件事儿上！ 银行劫匪回家后，受过MBA培训的小劫匪对只读完小学六年级的大劫匪说：\"大哥，我们来数数有多少钱。\"大一点的劫匪反驳说：\"你真笨，这么多钱，我们要花很长时间才能数清楚，今天晚上电视新闻会告诉咱们，咱俩到底从银行抢了多少钱！\" 这就是所谓的 \"经验\"，现在这社会，经验比纸面上的学历更重要！ 劫匪走后，银行经理让银行主管赶快报警，但主管对他说：\"等一下，我们从银行里拿出一千万来，自己用，再加上我们之前贪污的七千万\"。 这就是所谓的 \"顺应潮流 \"，你得将不利的局面转化成对自己有利的局面！ 主管说：\"要是每个月都有抢劫案，那就好了\"。 这叫 \"解闷儿 \"，个人的幸福感要比工作更重要。 第二天，电视新闻报道说，银行里有一亿美元被抢走了。劫匪们数啊数，数啊数，却只数到了2000万美元。劫匪们非常生气，抱怨道：\"我们冒着生命危险，只拿了两千万美元，银行经理弹指一挥间就拿走了8000万美元。看来，做贼不如多接受教育！\" 这就叫 \"知识就是金钱！\" 银行经理笑得合不拢嘴，因为他在股市上的损失，现在已经被这次抢劫案给弥补了。 这就叫 \"抓住机会\"，敢于冒险! 那么，这里谁才是这个故事里真正的强盗呢？！ ▌词汇: provocative: &#x2F;prə’vɒkətɪv&#x2F; provocative clothes, movements, pictures etc are intended to make someone sexually excited〔衣服、动作、图片等〕挑逗性的 civilized: a civilized society is well organized and developed, and has fair laws and customs 开化的，文明的 embezzle: &#x2F;ɪm’bez(ə)l&#x2F; to steal money from the place where you work 盗用，挪用，贪污; 侵吞 snap your fingers: to make a short, sharp noise by moving one of your fingers quickly against your thumb, for example in order to get someone’s attention or to mark the beat of music 打响指 daring: involving a lot of risk or danger, or brave enough to do risky things 勇敢的，大胆的 share: one of the equal parts into which the OWNERSHIP of a company is divided 股市，股份 https://qr.ae/pNWfAh","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What are some of the best moments of humanity?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2020/10/14/2020/2020-10-14-What-are-some-of-the-best-moments-of-humanity/","content":"What are some of the best moments of humanity?Doha Hemida, Tue Student 39.1k Views · 1.5k Upvotes This photo is of a man wanting to jump off a bridge in London.

Teen period is the best time for you to do something good with your life. Every hour you waste in that time is equivalent to wasting 10 hours in a later time period. I spent my 2nd semester break in one of Chennai’s largest libraries learning Java. I was also reading books like “How to get whatever you want” to improve my business skills. My 3rd semester break was spent in working with a professor on a project involved Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms. I also did a lot of coding with algorithms from CLRS. 4th semester break I spent in preparing for GRE [I had to write it early as people scared me about the new pattern that was coming that year]. Getting that monkey off my back early allowed me to fret less about what I will do after college. 5th semester break went in preparing for ACM ICPC programming contest and going to Asia regionals in Dhaka. 6th semester break went into working in a research project for which got IEEE student paper award. 7th semester break was into working on a project that got me an entry into HP’s Asian young inventors awards in Singapore. 8th semester break was spent working as Summer Research Fellow at IISc. Yes, this is a lot of bragging. Just to convince you how important is college life. There was not a single semester break I spent either at home or in travel. There were a lot of successful people I know who pretended as though they achieved without doing anything. I know how hard they worked and also how hard they worked to avoid you knowing how hard they worked. And that hardwork really paid off that time. There was a time during college when a tech company invited me to be their Chief guest for their new office inauguration and I was much younger to all the people applying for a job there — originally the folks there cleared me off to the jobseeker queue until they realised I was the one inaugurating the program. After graduation and joining work at my dream company, I spent a lot of time binge watching Netflix. That paid off too — as my career slowed down and hit a wall. My life’s momentum dropped to zero. I had to once again bring the momentum back. Every hour you spend at home or with TV during your younger years will come to bite you. Take up an internship to learn and contribute to the company. Their leaders will notice the new star. Or take up volunteering with a cause you most associate with and move the world a little closer to where you want it. Or take up a skill you could really master. Or work in a lab and really help your guide or other researchers to make their task easy [say collecting data, setting up experiments etc]. And read lots of books. You could still ignore all this and sit infront of Netflix or watch the World Cup. That could help you lot recounting stories of regret to your children and grandchildren. The reason why your teachers and parents stress so much on this is because they know how painful it is to screw up their time and endup like that.

And we have been together for a long time now! Here’s what makes us tick: We have at least one meal together. We try and be home for dinner every night. No social obligations and no work obligations stretch into the night for ‘us’ time. If I do need to go out with my coworkers, I make it a ‘happy hour’. This way I’m still home for dinner. Of course, this doesn’t always work, but 90% of the time, we make it happen. ‘Weather check in the middle of the day’. Both of us are engineers, and both our days are swamped with work. Sometimes I’m lucky if I can make time to wolf down a sandwich. While I’m doing that, I place a call to him, or he texts me. It’s a 2–5 minute call, but we make sure the other person is doing okay. ‘We date once a week’. We plan something ‘special’ once a week. Sometimes it is an impromptu beer outside, a hike during the weekends, a dinner outside on Friday night, a movie and popcorn at home, or I cook something special and light a candle.. right in the middle of the week. It works like a charm :) We hug as soon as we see each other. I can’t even tell you how good this makes me feel. Before we talk about our day, before a ‘hi’, we hug. It doesn’t matter if it is a quick one or a long one where I simply won’t let go. When something important comes up, we let the other person know right away or as soon as possible. This is important, and we make it a priority. If he sees me cooking&#x2F;cleaning, he always offers to help, and vice versa, unless of course one of us is working. No matter who wakes up first, we wish each other good morning. Nothing elaborate. A quick kiss, a quick hug, and a short whisper is more than enough. These are some of our everyday habits. It has worked wonderfully for both of us. Remember, you have to make your partner a priority.

When you’re thinking about buying something you don’t necessarily need, imagine the item in one hand and the cash in the other. Which one would you take? Never loan a friend more than you can afford to give away. If a job makes you pay money to work for them, it’s a scam. Want to find a good job after college? Make friends with as many people in your field that are on track to graduate one or two years ahead of you. Take a picture of business cards people hand you, just in case you lose them. Secretaries, tech support, and janitors are the true power in an office. Make friends with them and you’ll be able to get anything you need! If you forget someone’s name simply say, “Sorry, what was your name again?” They may look annoyed, but once they tell you their first name say, “No, I meant your last name.” The next time you stub your toe or get a cut, look away. The body oftentimes associates pain with sight. If you ever have to park in a city at night, park in front of a bank. They’re lit up and have cameras everywhere. Tie a small piece of brightly colored fabric to your luggage. You’ll be able to spot your bag at the airport in no time! Hang a picture of a tattoo you want somewhere you’ll see it every day for a year. If you still want it after that, then it’s worth getting. Success is a state of mind. If you want success, start thinking of yourself as a success. If you are buying headphones or speakers, test them out with “Bohemian Rhapsody“.

First thing in the morning when we wake up we kiss and hug each other, it’s like a bed coffee, continuing for 10yrs. It’s a daily routine. We both call each other in the morning to check whether we have reached our respective offices. Call in lunch-time to find out whether we had our lunch; not a single day missed without calling. She always cooks and I always clean, we never complained about this to each other. Wake up early on Weekends compared to weekdays, this will give a lot of time for both of us to spend together. Typically weekend starts with a long walk or long drive together. What may come, we ensure that we never leave each other and be alone for more than 2 weeks. We were lucky enough to follow this for last 10yrs. Friday night for sure we will watch one classic old Tamil movie together on TV. Always it would be a happy ending movie, so we go to sleep light-hearted and wake up the next day early with lots of positive energy. We respect our personal spaces and when one needs this space, we don’t interfere. Our mobile phone password is known to each other and can even exchange our phones for the entire day. There is nothing called secrets. She is a Tea lover, I make fantastic tea to make her happy. I am a coffee lover and she is a fabulous coffee maker to make me happy.

Don’t fill “To” field in email until you are completely done with the content of email. The period key and comma key move YouTube videos one frame forward and backward respectively. Be objective instead of being subjective. e.g. if someone send you an email with no attachment then say “attachment is missing in the email” instead of “you did not send attachment along with email”. Always check the air pressure in your spare tire and learn how to use it before going to long trip. If you are nervous about public speaking, go first, and do it. If it takes less than 15 minutes to do then do it now instead of procrastinating it for later. If you are getting in a large park with your kids, take a picture of your kids, so in case you lost them at park you can show how they look like and what they’re wearing. Use the “it was my understanding” with any idea or thought when talking professionally. If your printer ran out of black ink, then change the color of font to #010101, which is 99% grey and it will work fine. If someone is not shutting up and won’t let you talk, drop something, person will pause when you go down to pick it up. Use that as an opportunity to say your point. Before doing anything, think “would an idiot do that?” and now you got your answer. always remember X% of Y is equal to the Y% of X. Always check the reader first of the gas pump machine before entering your card in it. In setting put on the “undo” option for email so you have 30 seconds time to unsend the email, you wrongly sent. Apologize less and say thank you more e.g. say “thank you for listening” instead of saying “I’m sorry i talk too much”. I never break the hug first with the person I love or getting interested. If you hate splashing because of poop drop on water, put toilet paper on the top of water in commode. If someone ask “why are you so quiet?” answer them with “Why, are you nervous?” Always remember “NO” is a complete sentence. Sometimes you type something with all CAPS on and you don’t want to rewrite it all.

Law (2006)Answered Dec 31 353k Views · 2.8k Upvotes Travel before you have children. You won’t have that time again. Traveling with children is too hard. Get your schooling done before you have children. If you go to college, use the time to read, think, and let your curiosity be satisfied. You won’t have a time in your life again that is focused on developing your mind. If you smoke, quit now. Your heart and lungs will be very damaged if you continue. Now is the chance to make a decision the 40 year old version of you will be proud of yourself. If you are an alcoholic or drug addicted, get help now before you destroy the beautiful life you could have in the future. Addiction is usually self-medicating. So you need to get to the bottom of your pain. A therapist and a psychologist can help you. Or maybe you need to change your life, such as quit a job that is killing you or think about relationships you have that are toxic. Spend time with your grandparents and parents. They won’t live forever. Build those memories. If you make money, get a IRA and start saving. Now is the time to let compound interest work for you. Keep your student loan debt low. Go to community college and transfer into a four year program if you must. Keep it low. Because the future of careers is low, and you will be a debt slave forever. Try to find a mate that is a good person. Focus on someone you can have good conversations with, someone you respect, and someone who has the same life goals. If you want children, don’t date someone who does not. If you are introverted and hate parties, avoid the extrovert. If you are a low energy individual, find someone the same. When you reach your forties, think about your life. “Have I lived the life that has challenged me while bringing out my best self? Am I proud of what I have done? Or do I feel shame that I used my life to harm myself and others?” ▌词汇: schooling: school education 学校教育 self-medicating: 自我治疗； IRA: 个人退休账户，individual retirement account； compound interest: 复利, 复息: Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest.","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2019年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"Does life get better after 23?","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/2019/01/23/2019/2019-01-23-Does-life-get-better-after-23/","content":"Does life get better after 23?Prashant Motwani, Visiting Research Associate at Queen’s University Belfast (2018-present)Answered Sep 22, 2017 · Upvoted by Amala Pulavarthi, 17 years teen! 267.2k Views · 15.2k Upvotes At 23, I wanted a girlfriend At 26, I want to stay single till I get married At 23, I dreamt of IIT At 26, I dream of my own company At 23, complaints about what I don’t have were never-ending At 26, Complaints got replaced with gratitude and belief for what I already have at 23, I had no money to help someone in need At 26, I realized I don’t need money to help someone , a good heart and pure intentions is all it takes At 23, I thought no one understands me completely At 26, I try to understand others At 23, I focused on my looks At 26, I focus on my health at 23, I fought with my parents to buy me branded clothes and latest gadgets At 26, I fight with my work to spend time with my family At 23, applause and cheers were earned quite easily.

Sean Kernan, Son of Quora Answered Dec 29 ​ 98.9k Views · 9.8k Upvotes Proximity. I’ll explain. When you first start dating it’s super super easy, you (usually) hang out once, twice, thrice a week. The conditions are controlled and for small spans of time. It’s easy to keep your happy face on. Want to find out if your relationship is going to be solid? Go on a trip together. Go through the planning, then get packed, go to the airport together, be exposed to the stresses of travel, the hotels, the rental cars, the splitting of the bills, the sharing of hotel beds, the sharing of a bathroom sink for a solid 5 days. While you do this - you will likely spend 80% of your time within 5–10 feet of each other. Proximity. Over those days, you’ll quickly find out just how well you tolerate each other. Traveling is a fantastic relationship test. It keeps you in close quarters while also putting you both out of your comfort zones. Naturally good couples can spend long spans of time around each other in differing conditions. Unnaturally good couples quickly fall apart under this test. If your significant other suddenly starts getting mad at the way you brush your teeth every morning, it’s not a good sign. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 ▌词汇: solid: a solid achievement or solid work is of real, practical, and continuing value〔成就或工作〕相当好的，经得起时间考验的 proximity: &#x2F;prɑk’sɪməti&#x2F; nearness in distance or time〔距离或时间的〕接近，临近; 邻近 thrice: adv. 三次；三倍地；非常，十分； span: length of time over which sth lasts or extends from beginning to end （某事物）自始至终的持续时间或期间: the span of life 一生的时间； quarters: [pl] accommodation,esp for soldiers 住处; （尤指）营房: take up quarters in the nearest village 在最近的村中驻扎； split: the way in which something, especially money, is shared between several people〔尤指钱的〕分配: He should have split the bill with me. 简直该跟我分担账单。 significant other: your husband, wife, girlfriend, or boyfriend 重要的另一位〔指丈夫、妻子、女朋友或男朋友〕","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2019年","爱情"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"关于我","path":"/disheng2018/chatquora/about/index.html","content":"1、“Quora文选英语”公众号负责”美版知乎“Quora文章的翻译以及英语教育资源的分享，呈现最原汁原味的高质量英语问答。——好的文章不该被埋没！ 众所周知，Quora官网需要特殊工具才能访问，但是上面有很多优秀回答，所以我就负责摘录、整理。 2、“Quora文选英语”小红书利用小红书分享一些外网上的精选词汇 各种【标点符号】用英语怎么说？ 各种【线条】用英语怎么说？ 3、“RPA小站”公众号分享各类软件、视频资源以及小技巧的分享，关注我，不走冤枉路。 我是个优秀软件重度收集者，收集各种好用的小软件，帮大家提高效率。 输入法居然还能这么用：1秒录入3万字！ 推荐3款大神们都在用的轻量型的绘图工具"}]
