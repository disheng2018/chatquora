I knew it was a rotten idea from the beginning, he’d get drunk, they’d fight, I’d be referee. No way! The more he pushed the idea the worse I felt about it, I just knew something was wrong. I finally just said there was no way I’d go we’d already made plans for a birthday party with friends so they went alone. Two days later on my 20th birthday the State Police came to tell me my parents were dead, my father had killed my mother and then committed suicide. From a note he had left it was quite clear why he was so adamant that I came along. My instincts that day told me the trip was a bad idea and yes I was right.

I had read about the marshmallow test. You give a child a marshmallow, and then say that if she (Layla, in this case) could keep from eating it for 10 minutes, you’ll give her a second. So I tried that test with my granddaughter (not with marshmallows, but with chocolate, which she likes much more). According to extensive experiments, children who “pass” the “marshmallow test” are far more successful in later life. They have learned a fundamental truth in life, that delayed gratification can lead to a far better long-term outcome. She sat and watched the chocolate. The 10-minute hourglass finally emptied, and she had succeeded. She asked for her second piece of chocolate. I gave it to her, and she now had two in her hand. That’s when she looked up at me and asked, “Would you like one, Grandpa?” Needless to say, from that moment on I would readily give my life for her.

So I tried that test with my granddaughter (not with marshmallows, but with chocolate, which she likes much more).你给一个孩子一颗棉花糖，然后说如果她（在这个例子中是莱拉）能够忍住10分钟不吃它，你就会给她第二颗。所以我用巧克力而不是棉花糖，在我的孙女身上试了这个测试（因为她更喜欢巧克力）。 According to extensive experiments, children who “pass” the “marshmallow test” are far more successful in later life. They have learned a fundamental truth in life, that delayed gratification can lead to a far better long-term outcome.根据广泛的实验表明，“通过”了“棉花糖测试”的孩子们在后来的生活中会更加成功。他们学到了人生中一个基本真理：即“延迟满足”可以带来更好的长期结果。 She sat and watched the chocolate.

That’s when she looked up at me and asked, “Would you like one, Grandpa?”她坐着注视着那块巧克力。十分钟的沙漏终于倒空了，她成功了。她向我索要第二块巧克力。我给了她，并且此时她手里有两块巧克力。就在那时，她抬头看着我问道：“爷爷，你要一个吗？” Needless to say, from that moment on I would readily give my life for her.毫无疑问，从那一刻起，我愿意为她贡献出我的生命。 Habib F:That is the most beautiful thing I’ve read in a long,long while.这是我很长一段时间以来读到最好的故事。 https://qr.ae/pyhU6N","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2024年","亲情"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"你能给我讲一些鼓舞人心的事儿吗？_Quora文选","path":"/2024/04/30/2024/2024-04-30-Can-you-tell-me-something-inspiring_done/","content":"语言选择 欢迎关注“Quora文选”公众号 English 中英译文 1.

I was in college at that time, and I was struggling to cope with my studies and I had to take care of my ill father. I wasn’t concerned about anything else. My goal was just to finish college with a degree. He, too, attended the same college. We didn’t talk that much, but I did get some signals that he liked me and wanted to date me. But he never once confessed it. I was in my third year, when my father passed away. And practically, I had to live alone since my mother ran away with another guy while I was still a kid. I have no one to rely on, no relative to take care of me. I had no choice but to stay in hostel. One day, it was raining and he offered me a ride back to hostel. I was reading in the library and I had no idea about the time nor the weather. I had to say yes to him since it was dark and I didn’t bring my umbrella. That’s when he raped me- in his car. I was disturbed by that incident that I tried to cut my wrist, but all my attempt ended up in failure. I was into deep depression, and all I thought was how to survive. Then he started to manipulate me and forcing me to marry him. He would usually ask, ‘who’s going to take care of you since you have no family now?’ or ‘how are going to survive in this world with no one by your side?’ or ‘do you know how the people going to look at you if they knew you were raped? they wouldn’t stand by you; they probably think you’re cooking up a story to extort some money from me.’ and ‘no one would believe what you say’. Eventually I did marry him thinking there is no way I can live out in this world. But, I thank god, I didn’t bear any kids with him. Thinking about an innocent soul being born without love scared the hell out of me for all those years. It took me 4 years to realize that I can stand own my own two feet. I got an education, I can get jobs if I apply for one. I wont starve. I wouldn’t die. I divorced him, and now I’m working as IT analyst. I’m only 27, and I still haven’t given up hope in love. I’m still waiting for the one. PS: Sorry for my anonymity. I am comfortable with my self and hopeful of my future, but it’s gonna take a while for me to embrace my past.

So I tested some psychological tricks… Eye Contact I made strong eye contact while smiling when I first entered the room. She always smiled back! Proximity I made sure I picked a chair way in the front of the room and close to where she was sitting. I noticed she began to pay more attention to me!

She was glowing with happiness. The day came. She couldn’t contain herself. She was all over her gifts, planning, protecting, arranging. Everything had to be perfect. As soon as dinner was over, she jumped up from her chair and took her gifts. She went around, giving each one of us her piece of love. These were small value items, but it was the meaning of her giving heart that we were really feeling. As she gave to each person, she paused. She watched the expression on our faces. Our smiles were her greatest reward. Her last gift was for my back then 2-year-old boy: A rocking pony ride-on toy. It’s hard to describe the explosion of delight that my little boy had on his face when he got this gift! For several minutes, everyone was totally absorbed, our attention taken up watching him go all around the house making it a rodeo arena. Even though the pony is designed to be a static rocking horse — his excitement was so significant that the horse slid a few inches forward or backward with every thrust he exerted into the little toy. My little girl watched, rewarded with a huge smile on her face. Somehow, witnessing these acts of giving love from my 11-year-old helped me understand the power of giving. Giving from the heart. Giving from the inside out. Later that day, my girl received some gifts, but she didn’t need them. She was focused on others, not on herself. It was evident that she was the one feeling true JOY.

I have a surprise for everyone… no peeking!” she insisted, and I never hesitated.I purchased everything.“拜托了，爸爸！这些东西会在圣诞节前到达。我给大家准备了一个惊喜……绝对不许偷看！”她坚持说道，并且我没有犹豫就买下了所有东西。 A couple of days later she got everything.I saw her then wrapping all her gifts.“Can I help you?”“No, Dad. I told you these are special surprises. Absolutely no peeking!”Her excitement was visible. She was proud. She was alive. She was glowing with happiness.几天后，她收到了所有东西。 然后我看见她正在包装所有礼物。 “我能帮忙吗？” “不用了，爸爸。我告诉过你这些都是特别的惊喜，绝对不能偷看！” 她兴奋得无法掩饰，她感到自豪、充满活力、幸福地发光。 The day came. She couldn’t contain herself. She was all over her gifts, planning, protecting, arranging. Everything had to be perfect.那一天终于来临。她难以抑制自己的激动心情，在礼物周围忙碌着——规划、保护、安排——每件事都要尽善尽美。 As soon as dinner was over, she jumped up from her chair and took her gifts. She went around, giving each one of us her piece of love. These were small value items, but it was the meaning of her giving heart that we were really feeling.晚餐一结束，她便从椅子上跳起来拿起了她的礼物。她走到每个人身边，将一片爱心递给我们每一个人。这些都是价值不大的小物件，但我们真正感受到的是她那颗赠予之心所蕴含的意义。 As she gave to each person, she paused. She watched the expression on our faces.在给每个人礼物时，她都会停下来观察我们脸上的表情。 Our smiles were her greatest reward.我们的微笑是对她最大的回报。 Her last gift was for my back then 2-year-old boy: A rocking pony ride-on toy.她最后一个礼物送给了当时只有两岁的儿子：一匹摇摆小马玩具车。 It’s hard to describe the explosion of delight that my little boy had on his face when he got this gift!很难形容我小男孩收到这份礼物时脸上喜悦爆发出来的样子！ For several minutes, everyone was totally absorbed, our attention taken up watching him go all around the house making it a rodeo arena. Even though the pony is designed to be a static rocking horse — his excitement was so significant that the horse slid a few inches forward or backward with every thrust he exerted into the little toy.几分钟内，所有人完全被吸引住了，我们全神贯注地看着他骑着小马在房间里四处游荡，仿佛把整个房间变成了一个竞技场场地。尽管这匹小马本设计为静态摇摆木马——但他兴致勃勃至极使得每次用力推动这个玩具时都能让木马前后滑动几英寸。 My little girl watched, rewarded with a huge smile on her face.我的小女儿在旁观看，脸上露出巨大的微笑作为回报。 Somehow, witnessing these acts of giving love from my 11-year-old helped me understand the power of giving.Witnessing these acts of love from my eleven-year-old somehow made me comprehend deeply about what it means to give selflessly.某种程度上，在见证我11岁孩子展现出如此施予爱心行径中帮助我理解了施予之力量所在。 Giving from the heart.发自内心地给予。 Giving from the inside out.由内而外地施与。 Later that day, my girl received some gifts, but she didn’t need them. She was focused on others, not on herself.那天晚些时候，我的女儿收到了一些礼物，但她并不需要它们。她关注于他人而非自己。 It was evident that she was the one feeling true JOY.显然，真正感受到快乐的是她自己。 She was full.她满足了。 https://qr.ae/pyFbYM","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2024年","亲情"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"你和你周围的人有何不同？_Quora文选","path":"/2024/04/22/2024/2024-04-22-How-are-you-different-from-others-around-you_done/","content":"语言选择 欢迎关注“Quora文选”公众号 English 中英译文 1.

And donated Rs. 50 to the handicapped beggar near the temple.她回答道： “非常好呀，先生，多亏了您给我的钱。我用150卢比往返于我儿子所在村庄之间；用100卢比买了些糖果分给大家；还花200卢比给我的孙子买了一件衬衫和一条裤子；另外还捐出50卢比给寺庙附近的残疾乞丐。” Hence, Money can bring you happiness if you share it with people who know its value and are true need of it.所以，如果你将金钱分享给那些知晓其价值，并真正需要它的人，它便能为你带来幸福。 https://qr.ae/psYpxi","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2024年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"别人对你做过最美的事情是什么？_Quora文选","path":"/2024/03/30/2024/2024-03-30-What's-the-nicest-thing-anyone-has-ever-done-for-you_done/","content":"语言选择 欢迎关注“Quora文选”公众号 English 中英译文 1. EnglishWhat’s the nicest thing anyone has ever done for you? Bruno Valle · Works at Bain &amp; Company ​ 231.6K views · 14.5k Upvotes I was on a train in France in 2006 - the overnight train from Nice to Rome. Being young backpackers, my friend and I had paid for the cheapest fare possible, which meant sleeping in tight chairs in a packed car. At some point in the middle of the night, I get woken up by a rough hand shaking my shoulder. I looked up to see a tall blonde man in a baseball cap looking down at me. “Someone just took something out of your bag!”, he said to me in an American accent, before waking up a few people next to us which had also been robbed. Once we awakened, he explained “I just saw three guys rummaging through your bags and taking out cash and valuables. When they saw me they went straight to back of the train, we need to get them!” I didn’t think it was safe to confront 3 train robbers in the middle of the night in the last car of a speeding train, so I said “Shouldn’t we tell the conductor first?” The baseball cap guy was seething and clearly didn’t want to wait for the conductor. He said “Ok, you go to the front and tell the conductor, and…” he looked around, trying to find someone or something. His gaze landed on a hulking curled up figure, sleeping under a blanket and cap. This sleeping guy was at least 6’6’’. Baseball cap guy walked towards him shook him roughly “You, hey, wake up, I need your help. Three guys just ran down the train car stealing from bags, we need to get them.” The sleeping guy pulled off his blanket and stood up. He was gigantic, and was wearing an “Australia Rugby” shirt. The baseball guy was clearly satisfied with his new recruit, and they marched to the back of the train followed by the excited group of victims and onlookers. I made my way to the front of the train and alerted the conductor of what was happening – he said he couldn’t do anything until we reached Marseille, when he would ask the “railroad police” to board the train and investigate the thefts. Dejected, I went back to my seat to tell the other travelers about this, but no one was there. I could hear yelling coming from the back of the train so I walked past the next few cars and got there. There was a commotion in front of the last door, as baseball cap guy, Australian rugby guy and 10 other people jostled and yelled at the last door. The 3 suspects had been chased down by the baseball&#x2F;rugby duo and had barricaded themselves in the last car. They were clearly scared, but were screaming back at the crowd in broken English “We have knife! We have knife!”. Soon, baseball&#x2F;rugby duo decided they had enough. The massive Australian rugby player started to kick the door repeatedly, putting his full weight behind each kick. The cutpurses stared at the door after each kick, trying to see how long it could take them. They talked among themselves and made a decision. The trio pulled out thousands of Euros in cash, jewelry and other valuables and dropped them on the ground, saying “Ok! Ok! What you want!” and ran to the back of the last car. Soon team baseball&#x2F;rugby had gotten the door open, but the 3 hoodlums were gone – they had jumped out of the moving train in fear. But baseball cap guy and rugby guy were celebrated as heroes for the rest of the ride. If they hadn’t intervened, the robbers would have escaped with the money when the train slowed down. The baseball cap guy was a retired cop from New York, and the rugby guy just played rugby in university. I think they both deserve “nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.” ▌词汇: 1️⃣ 𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐞 &#x2F;ˈrʌmɪdʒ, -ɪdʒ&#x2F;n. 搜寻，翻找；v. 翻找，搜寻She rummaged through her drawers looking for her missing keys.（她在抽屉里翻找，寻找她丢失的钥匙。） 2️⃣ 𝐬𝐞𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞 &#x2F;siːð&#x2F;v. 沸腾，激动，发怒The boiling water began to seethe and bubble.（沸水开始沸腾和冒泡。） 3️⃣ 𝐡𝐮𝐥𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 &#x2F;ˈhʌlkɪŋ&#x2F;adj. 巨大的，庞大的He was a hulking figure, towering over the others in the room.（他是一个庞大的身影，在房间里高高地耸立着。） 4️⃣ 𝐠𝐢𝐠𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜 &#x2F;dʒaɪˈɡæntɪk&#x2F;adj. 巨大的，庞大的The gigantic elephant dominated the landscape.（巨大的大象主宰了这片土地。） 5️⃣ 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭 &#x2F;rɪˈkruːt&#x2F;n. 新兵，新成员；v. 招募，征募The army recruited young men to join its ranks.（军队征募年轻人加入其队伍。） 6️⃣ 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 &#x2F;kəˈməʊʃ(ə)n&#x2F;n. 骚乱，动乱，喧闹There was a commotion in the street as the protesters clashed with the police.（示威者与警察发生冲突，街上一片骚乱。） 7️⃣ 𝐫𝐮𝐠𝐛𝐲 &#x2F;ˈrʌɡbi&#x2F;n. 橄榄球（运动）He played rugby for his school team.（他为校队打橄榄球。） 8️⃣ 𝐣𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐥𝐞 &#x2F;ˈdʒɒs(ə)l&#x2F;v. 推挤，拥挤，争抢People jostled each other as they tried to get onto the crowded train.（人们互相挤来挤去，试图挤上拥挤的火车。） 9️⃣ 𝐝𝐮𝐨 &#x2F;ˈduːəʊ&#x2F;n. 二人组，双人组合The musical duo performed a beautiful duet together.（这个音乐二重奏一起演奏了一首美妙的二重唱。） 🔟 𝐛𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐝𝐞 &#x2F;ˌbærɪˈkeɪd&#x2F;n. 栅栏，路障，障碍物Protesters erected barricades to block off the street.（抗议者设置了路障来封锁街道。） 1️⃣1️⃣ 𝐜𝐮𝐭𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞 &#x2F;ˈkʌtpɜːs&#x2F;n. 扒手，小偷The cutpurse stole the wallet from the distracted tourist.（扒手从分心的游客那里偷走了钱包。） 1️⃣2️⃣ 𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐝𝐥𝐮𝐦 &#x2F;ˈhʊdləm&#x2F;n. 暴徒，流氓The hoodlum was arrested for vandalism.（这个暴徒因故意破坏被逮捕了。） 2. 中英译文别人对你做过最美的事情是什么？_Quora文选 I was on a train in France in 2006 - the overnight train from Nice to Rome.2006年，我在法国乘坐了一列从尼斯开往罗马的夜班火车。 Being young backpackers, my friend and I had paid for the cheapest fare possible, which meant sleeping in tight chairs in a packed car. At some point in the middle of the night, I get woken up by a rough hand shaking my shoulder.作为年轻的背包客，我和我的朋友选择了最便宜的票价，这意味着我们得在拥挤的车厢里紧靠着椅子睡觉。半夜时分，一个粗糙的手摇晃我的肩膀，将我唤醒。 I looked up to see a tall blonde man in a baseball cap looking down at me.我抬头看到一个戴棒球帽、金发碧眼的高个男子正俯视着我。 “Someone just took something out of your bag!”, he said to me in an American accent, before waking up a few people next to us which had also been robbed.“有人刚从你包里拿走东西！”他用美国口音对我说，并叫醒了我们旁边几位也遭窃的人。 Once we awakened, he explained “I just saw three guys rummaging through your bags and taking out cash and valuables. When they saw me they went straight to back of the train, we need to get them!”我们醒来后，他解释道：“我刚看到三个家伙在你们包里翻找并取出现金和贵重物品。当他们看到我时就直奔火车尾部，我们得去抓住他们！” I didn’t think it was safe to confront 3 train robbers in the middle of the night in the last car of a speeding train, so I said “Shouldn’t we tell the conductor first?” The baseball cap guy was seething and clearly didn’t want to wait for the conductor. He said “Ok, you go to the front and tell the conductor, and…” he looked around, trying to find someone or something.面对三名火车强盗，在深夜飞驰中的列车末节车厢内与之正面冲突，在我看来并不安全，因此我提议：“我们是不是应该先告诉列车员？”那位戴棒球帽的男士怒气冲冲，并显然不想等待列车员处理。“好吧，你去前头告诉列车员。”他环顾四周寻找某人或某物时说道。 His gaze landed on a hulking curled up figure, sleeping under a blanket and cap. This sleeping guy was at least 6’6’’.他目光落在一个裹在毛毯下、戴着帽子沉睡中巨大身影上，这个沉睡者至少有六英尺六英寸高。 Baseball cap guy walked towards him shook him roughly “You, hey wake up! I need your help. Three guys just ran down this way stealing from bags; we need catch them.”棒球帽男士走向他并粗暴地摇晃，“喂！快醒醒！需要你帮忙，刚才有三个家伙往这边跑偷东西了，咱们得追上他们。” The sleeping guy pulled off his blanket and stood up. He was gigantic ,and wearing an “Australia Rugby” shirt . 那沉睡者掀开毛毯站起身来，体型庞大且穿着一件“澳洲橄榄球”衬衫 。 The baseball guy clearly satisfied with his new recruit ,and they marched toward back of train followed by excited group victims onlookers .I made my way front alerting conductor what happening –he said couldn’t do anything until reached Marseille when would ask “railroad police” board investigate thefts . 棒球帽男士显然对这新招募的人很满意，随即领队向火车后部进发，被劫及围观群众跟随其后。我则前往通知司机所发生之事 —— 司机表示除非达到马赛否则无能为力，届时会请求铁路警方登船调查失窃事件。 Dejected ,went back seat telling other travelers about this but no one there .could hear yelling coming back so past next few cars got there commotion front last door as baseball cap Australian rugby others jostled yelled last door . 我心情沮丧地回到座位欲告知其他旅客此事，但无人在场。能听见后方传来喊声于是越过数节 车厢抵达现场 在最后一扇门前 棍球帽与澳洲橄榄球衬衣以及其他十余人推挤喊叫 。 The 3 suspects had been chased down by the baseball&#x2F;rugby duo and had barricaded themselves in the last car. They were clearly scared, but were screaming back at the crowd in broken English “We have knife! We have knife!”.三名嫌疑人被棒球/橄榄球二人组追赶，并在最后一节车厢内设下了防线。他们显然很害怕，但仍用蹩脚的英语对着人群大喊：“我们有刀！我们有刀！” Soon, baseball&#x2F;rugby duo decided they had enough. The massive Australian rugby player started to kick the door repeatedly, putting his full weight behind each kick. The cutpurses stared at the door after each kick, trying to see how long it could take them. They talked among themselves and made a decision.不久，棒球/橄榄球二人组决定采取行动。那位体型庞大的澳洲橄榄球运动员开始反复踢门，每一次都倾尽全力。扒手们每次踢门后都盯着门看，试图估算自己还能撑多久。他们相互讨论并做出了决定。 The trio pulled out thousands of Euros in cash, jewelry and other valuables and dropped them on the ground, saying “Ok! Ok! What you want!” and ran to the back of the last car.这三个人拿出数千欧元现金、珠宝和其他贵重物品丢在地上，说道：“Ok！Ok！给你们想要的！”然后跑到了最后一节车厢的末端。 Soon team baseball&#x2F;rugby had gotten the door open, but the 3 hoodlums were gone – they had jumped out of the moving train in fear.不久之后，棒球/橄榄球二人组打开了门，但是那三个嫌疑人已经消失了 —— 他们因为恐惧而从移动中的火车上跳了下去。 But baseball cap guy and rugby guy were celebrated as heroes for the rest of the ride. If they hadn’t intervened, the robbers would have escaped with money when train slowed down. The baseball cap guy was a retired cop from New York, and rugby guy just played rugby in university.但是戴棒球帽的哥们儿和玩橄榄球的哥们儿在剩余旅程中被当作英雄来庆贺，如果他们没有介入，当火车减速时强盗就会带着钱逃跑了。戴棒球帽的哥们儿是纽约退役警察，而玩橄榄球的哥们儿只是在大学里玩过橄榄球罢了。 I think they both deserve “nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.”我认为他们俩都值得“任何人为我所做过最美好事情”的称号。 https://qr.ae/pyP6Gt","tags":["Quora文选","2024年"]},{"title":"什么事儿让老师颇为自豪？_Quora文选","path":"/2024/03/30/2024/2024-03-30-What-makes-a-teacher-the-proudest_done/","content":"语言选择 欢迎关注“Quora文选”公众号 English 中英译文 1.

He was “bored.” How he could be bored on the first day of vacation was beyond me. He finally had freedom, and we had only finished school 20 minutes before. So I asked him what he wanted to be as an adult and he said “Lawyer.” My father was a lawyer, studying in his patrolcar while he worked for the police department, and his journey through law school, to his first office in an empty building to his eventual success, ten years into his career, stuck with me always.

They will say no, your job is to try, their job is to say no. Eventually, you’ll find someone who doesn’t say no.” He left, I forgot about it. Kids usually ignore what you teach. But when I got back from Winter break, he’d already started interning at a law firm, the 21st one he called.

But I also don’t agree with a hardcore “never let them win until they force it”.我认为让孩子通过虚假的胜利来增强信心绝对是个坏主意 —— 那只不过是虚假的自信。但同时，我也不赞成极端地“从不让他们获胜，直到他们靠实力取胜”这种方法。 I have found my hybrid “teaching way” to allow me to teach her the game more quickly.我发现我的混合型“教学方式”能够让我更快地教会她这个游戏。 I should point out that she’s a lot smarter than I am and so I’m only hastening the time of my own doom. :-)值得一提的是，她在这方面比我聪明得多，因此这种方法无疑加速了我的输局。:-) https://qr.ae/ps2fHL","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2024年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"足够聪明的人会认识到哪些事儿？_Quora文选","path":"/2024/03/29/2024/2024-03-29-My-dad-once-told-me-you-should-be-smart-enough-to-realize-this_done/","content":"语言选择 欢迎关注“Quora文选”公众号 English 中英译文 1.

EnglishWhat are some lessons that life teaches you?Elizabeth Collins, B.S. in Human Biology &amp; Psychology, University of California 719.8K views · 23.8K upvotes Cooking and cleaning is a basic life skill and not a gender role. If you don’t clear your misunderstanding in time, they became the reason for distance forever. If you want it, work for it. It’s that simple. The gap between the life you could live and the life you are living is called focus. If you’re not dating to marry, then you’re dating for heartbreak. Let that sink in and be in serious relationship. Stop comparing yourself with who started 10 years before you. Focus on your own journey. Confidence is not “I’m better than them”, confidence is “I’m great, so are they” Every time I lower my frequency to meet someone on their level I end up paying for it. That’s a lesson I really don’t need to learn anymore. Rise up to meet me. Real growth is when you start checking and correcting yourself. Instead of blaming others, you take your power back by being responsible for your life. You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending. Being kind to yourself is the best medicine. And there is always, always, always something to be thankful for. ▌评论: Uriah Takao:“You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending”. Nice.

It’s that simple.如果你渴望某样东西，那就为之努力，就这么简单，干就完了。 The gap between the life you could live and the life you are living is called focus.理想中的生活与现实生活之间的差距，取决于你的专注程度。 If you’re not dating to marry, then you’re dating for heartbreak. Let that sink in and be in serious relationship.如果你约会不是为了结婚，那么你只是在准备在分手的时候心碎的，所以请深思熟虑，并认真对待恋爱关系。 Stop comparing yourself with who started 10 years before you. Focus on your own journey.停止与十年前开始他们旅程的人比较，专注于走自己的道路。 Confidence is not “I’m better than them”, confidence is “I’m great, so are they”自信并不是“我比他们强”，而是“我很棒，他们也一样”。 Every time I lower my frequency to meet someone on their level I end up paying for it. That’s a lesson I really don’t need to learn anymore. Rise up to meet me.每次我降低自己的频率去适应别人时总要付出代价，这个教训我已经学够了，就让他们提升到我的高度来找我吧！ Real growth is when you start checking and correcting yourself. Instead of blaming others, you take your power back by being responsible for your life.真正的成长始于自省和自纠，不怨天尤人，而是通过对自己负责收回属于自己的掌控权。” You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.无法回头改变起点，但可以从现在开始改写终点。 Being kind to yourself is the best medicine.善待自己乃至上良药。 And there is always, always, always something to be thankful for.这世上总有值得你去感激的事。” https://qr.ae/pvkxuf","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"怎样才能选择一个好伴侣？_Quora文选","path":"/2023/04/20/2023/2023-04-20-What-is-the-best-way-to-choose-life-partner_done/","content":"语言选择 欢迎关注“Quora文选”公众号 English 中英译文 1.

I have no regrets about any of the money I spent helping them achieve their goals. I don’t even have regrets about the 2 heart attacks and high blood pressure I gave myself fending for them.

You only have 24 hours each day and maybe only this one life; Don’t waste a single second. Go Outside - Add a bit of nature (ideally a natural body of water of some sort) to your daily routine. The calm will often reset you. Meditate - Work out your body, your mind and your heart and soul. Go inward. Learn about yourself. And improve.

What is one thing you will do better tomorrow? Be A Hero - First identify who that is and then take a step there daily. It makes an astounding difference when you choose where you want to go. Hug Someone - Release some oxytocin by being physical. If that is not possible then help someone. If you can’t do that, then be charitable. Be Present - This moment is all that matters. Take it in. You are alive now. Work with purpose, laugh with true joy or do what you need to do in the here and now. Break A Limit - Push a boundary and test your limits.

Try a couple of strawberries or grapes instead or some honey will also do the trick. Start reading and I mean physical books. They are an amazing stress reliever. Never stop dreaming and keep on setting goals. You must have heard the phrase “Never Settle” a number of times in life and there’s a reason for that. When you work towards something, towards a specific goal, then you’ll automatically be motivated to do other stuff. That energy, that feeling of seeing something in front of you and then working towards it is amazing. Exercise daily. Period. Go outside for a minimum of 30 min daily and get some sunlight. Early morning is the best time. OUTSIDE GOOOODDD, INSIDE BAADDD. Always use protection. All your success wouldn’t mean shit if you got an unexpected bun in the oven. Never ever watch porn. No matter what happens, never ever watch porn. Use your imagination if need be but avoid porn at all cost. I can’t stress this point enough. Realize that life works at a very slow pace. This sounds a lot easy but trust me, its way more difficult in practical. In the age of internet, we easily develop the habit of instant gratification. Want something to eat ? It’s just 2 clicks away. Wanna order clothes ? Just pick your phone and select from latest trends and this will cost you less than actually visiting the store or a restaurant, thanks to discounts. This creates a habit loop of EXPECTING everything INSTANTLY, which is the number one reason for stress. We just don’t realize that everything takes time, that dreams are not achieved by working overnight and this is why most people give up. So slow down, take a deep breath and slowly but constantly work towards your goal. In the pipelne.. edit coming soon ;) And never forget to enjoy life every chance you get. Realize that one day, not today, not tomorrow, but one day in distant future, probably in a galaxy far far away, you are going to die and everything will be for nothing. So work on yourself but make sure to enjoy in everything you pick to do in life. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 https://qr.ae/prXAE0","tags":["Quora文选","2022年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"What made you decide to be child free or to have children?","path":"/2022/11/24/2022/2022-11-24-What-made-you-decide-to-be-child-free-or-to-have-children/","content":"What made you decide to be child free or to have children?Dan Andersen 1.4M views · 4.4K upvotes My wife and I met, she was 20 I was 18.

These are among the best things I have ever learned: You spend your first 20 years worrying what people think about you. You spend your next 20 years swearing that you don’t care what people think about you. You spend the next 20 years realizing that they aren’t thinking about you. A liberation! Any day on this side of the dirt is a good day. Some people didn’t make the cut last night. I was hit by a speeding taxi as I was walking to a bus stop. I spent a month in rehab with two broken legs, a brain injury, multiple back injuries and other fractures. The night before I was hit, a young, married couple was also hit. They both died. Practice gratitude. A woman I know spends most of her time thinking about how much she hates her thighs. She can give you a detailed report on what is wrong with them. She forgets all the places those legs have taken her, all the miles they have walked for her. It doesn’t occur to her that when she gets up in the middle of the night to pee, those very thighs walk her to the toilet. Spend more time appreciating what you’ve got— a heart that beats, a way to pick up your cup of coffee, the eyes that see that cup and know what color it is. Blessings abound. There are two kinds of people in this world – those who believe there is enough to go around, and those who don’t. Here is an example: If Margo is leaning up against the car kissing her boyfriend, and I think how nice that must feel, do I try to steal Margo’s boyfriend or do I go out and get my own boyfriend? I go out and get myself a boyfriend. I don’t need to steal Margo’s. I know that there is enough to go around. An old Native American woman was asked why she was always so happy.

This woman looked at me weird, then started walking towards me (so she could go to the bus stop), she tripped over in her heels and collapsed on the floor, she was fine but her groceries fell out of her bag and her milk bottle was ruined. I then immediately got up, walked over and helped her up, then I started to pack her stuff into her bag, I asked if she was alright and she said she was fine. I then got the milk bottle and chucked it in the nearest bin, grabbed coins from my pocket and gave it to her to buy a new bottle of milk. She said she couldn’t take the money as it “felt wrong to take it” but she eventually accepted it and thanked me. She said goodbye and then she said “wait smile again, you look so beautiful and happy” “you remind me of myself back in the old days” and then walked away. It didn’t really change my life but I felt like the compliment was a blessing in disguise. I’m not always happy but I was glad to see her smiling as well, she didn’t smile or look happy only until after the situation, I felt sorry for her because she seemed too kind and genuine, I thought that she would’ve had a hard past or some experience that made her say what she did to me.

Leaving your hometown in your 20s is a life hack. Not all success is due to hard work, it can be due to smart work. The beliefs you have about yourself will determine how you treat yourself. Sometimes people don’t have the capacity to love us the way we need to be loved. Growth and change can feel uncomfortable. But, lack of growth and change can be detrimental. We may keep encountering the same lesson until we are ready to learn it. It’s normal. We gravitate towards the familiar because it gives us a false sense of safety. Most of us will choose a familiar pain over an unknown alternative. The deepest form of loneliness comes from being estranged from ourselves, not from others. Relationships are not just something we choose, they are something we build. Communication is not just about what we say, but also about how we say it. There is often an emphasis on us learning how to offer love, rarely are we taught how to receive it. Both skills are equally important for us to have. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 ▌评论: Marcus McNary:“Not all success is due to hard work, it can be due to smart work”.Trust funds, coming from a well connected, financially stable and comfortable home also helps. ▌词汇: detrimental: &#x2F;ˌdɛtrɪ’mɛntl&#x2F; causing harm or damage 有害的，不利的 estrange:尤用於被动语态~ sb (from sb) cause (sb formerly loving or friendly) to become unfriendly to sb 使（某人）疏远某人; 离间 https://qr.ae/pva9Zg","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What is true love？","path":"/2022/10/03/2022/2022-10-03-what-is-true-love/","content":"What is true love？Gaia 911.5k Views · 18.1k Upvotes My parents were married for 55 years. One morning, my mom was going downstairs to make dad breakfast, she had a heart attack and fell. My father picked her up as best he could and almost dragged her into the truck. At full speed, without respecting traffic lights, he drove her to the hospital. When he arrived, unfortunately, she was no longer with us. During the funeral, my father did not speak; his gaze was lost. He hardly cried. That night, his children joined him. In an atmosphere of pain and nostalgia, we remembered beautiful anecdotes and he asked my brother, a theologian, to tell him where Mom would be at that moment. My brother began to talk about life after death, and guesses as to how and where she would be. My father listened carefully. Suddenly he asked us to take him to the cemetery. Dad!” we replied, “it’s 11 at night, we can’t go to the cemetery right now!” He raised his voice, and with a glazed look he said: “Don’t argue with me, please don’t argue with the man who just lost his wife of 55 years.” There was a moment of respectful silence, we didn’t argue anymore. We went to the cemetery, we asked the night watchman for permission. With a flashlight, we reached the tomb. My father caressed her, prayed, and told his children, who watched the scene moved: “It was 55 years… you know? No one can talk about true love if they have no idea what it’s like to share life with a woman.” He paused and wiped his face. “She and I, we were together in that crisis. I changed jobs …” he continued. “We packed up when we sold the house and moved out of town. We shared the joy of seeing our children finish their careers, we mourned the departure of loved ones side by side, we prayed together in the waiting room of some hospitals, we support each other in pain, we hug each Christmas, and we forgive our mistakes… Children, now it’s gone, and I’m happy, do you know why? Because she left before me. She didn’t have to go through the agony and pain of burying me, of being left alone after my departure. I will be the one to go through that, and I thank God. I love her so much that I wouldn’t have liked her to suffer…” When my father finished speaking, my brothers and I had tears streaming down our faces. We hugged him, and he comforted us, “It’s okay, we can go home, it’s been a good day.” That night I understood what true love is; It is far from romanticism, it does not have much to do with eroticism, or with sex, rather it is linked to work, to complement, to care and, above all, to the true love that two really committed people profess“.

There were some group projects we were doing. I can remember I got paired with an attractive brunette girl, short, 5′2, maybe 100 lbs, big mousey eyes, young, maybe 21 at most. And I can even remember her name still, Nicole. After our group project, where we got to know each other, she began sitting beside me every day in class. Even if I changed seats, she’d find me like a heat seeking missile. She’d lean over and whisper “Hey!” before plopping down next to me. Apparently my wedding ring was invisible. I’d often groan with this pain-pleasure feeling as she approached. It was as though God had sent this gorgeous archangel to tempt my faith in marriage. And, to be fair, I did enjoy talking to her. She was very nice, interesting, and well, damn-attractive. Getting married doesn’t turn you into an invincible Faith-Bot. Things sort of came to a head one day as we left class. As we stepped outside the doors, with other students filing out, she touched her hair and said: “Hey, do you think you could give me a ride home?” She winked after she said it with a big smile. I paused and felt my heart beating faster. And painnnnnfully said, ~“I….I really shouldn’t. ……I have to be somewhere in like 15 minutes. And I can’t be late.” I say “painfully” because that is me being honest. I was 100% faithful to my wife during our marriage. But to say there weren’t moments like this, would be disingenuous. In the split moment of Nicole’s veiled invitation, I saw this door in my mind. Going through that door, I saw this rush, all of this lusty imagery that I could partake in. It would have surely been great. For that moment. I knew, from having known guys who’d gone through that door, what happens next. And it isn’t pretty. Once that door is open, there is no closing it, no going back. You will keep going. And it will lead to a dark place. A dark place where things that can’t be undone will undo everything good in your life. In these situations, you need to use your head and think vividly about consequences, or those consequences will become your reality. Most importantly, you need to pay credence to the love and respect you have for your spouse. It can all go away, faster than you’d imagine. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 ▌评论: Richard Nwachukwu:Funny thing is…The moment you get married, you begin to see pretty ladies even more.

Dad told stories. Sister laughed. Mom rolled her eyes. Wife listened and smiled with unbridled joy; she didn’t have this growing up. We watched a fantastic movie. Ate ice cream. We took a walk at sunset around my neighborhood. I threw a football with my dad for a few minutes. Tomorrow, I get to see my grandparents and the rest of my extended family. My wife is asleep next to me. She’s pregnant with our first child. A girl. Doctor says she’s developed enough to hear now. She heard her grandfather’s roaring laughter tonight, a sound she’ll be all too familiar with before too long. I don’t have a large bank account. I don’t have a big house. We live a modest life. But we are rich in blessings and love. And in this tiny moment tonight, I am thankful and happy. 展开翻译 待更新 ▌评论: Maryjesse Johnston:Print and frame this answer.

Emily Payton, BSc Psychology (2021) 313.4K views · 1.8K upvotes Lazy people get out of bed, because staying in bed all day is boring. Lazy people shower, because being dirty is uncomfortable. Lazy people form connections with others, because social relationships are rewarding. Lazy people enjoy things. They enjoy food, or video games, or drinking, or masturbating, or smoking, or watching TV, or talking to friends on the phone all night. They have the capacity for excitement and happiness, even if the things that make them happy are 100% hedonistic. Lazy people are relaxed. They are not afraid to go outside, or get out of bed or see people. They do not have panic attacks. They don’t fear being awake, so they don’t sleep all day. The thought of working – or failing – does not terrify them. They don’t hide their face. They see the value in being alive, and appreciate the world they are living in. Lazy people generally don’t complain about hating themselves, or hating their life, or wanting to be better but being unable to do so – that’s too much effort for someone who is lazy. Someone who is lazy doesn’t care enough to think that way. I could see why a lazy person would lie about having depression to get out of doing something, but I doubt they would have the commitment to make it really convincing. Depression is not laziness. Sure, some of the behaviors are the same, and I can understand your confusion, but they actually look very different. Saying that depression is the same as laziness is a bit like saying cats are the same as dogs, because they’re both furry and have four legs. Well, yes, but when you look a little closer you’ll recognize all the little shapes, joints and quirks that differentiate them. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 ▌评论: Leah Crawford:A wonderful answer.

She went to her fridge and said, “gee, I am out of milk.” Then she turned to me and said, “what just went through your head when I said that?” I responded, “I considered how I could get you some milk.” She said to me, “that’s right. You thought that because you are a woman. A man won’t think that way. He will hear it as a fact. FACT: NO MILK. He will not read more into it than that. If you want to have a happy marriage, never assume that he knew what you were hinting.“ She told me that I should be sure to clearly and kindly say, “honey we are out of milk, and it would make me very happy if you could grab some on the way home.” Her advice has proved very wise.

When my wife, Isabelle, and I moved to Asia, Isabelle insisted that we not have a live-in maid. I wanted one to make our lives easy. In the end, you can guess what happened - we didn’t get the maid. Instead, we’ve got a part-time maid who does the cleaning and laundry. Now, around a decade on, I really see the wisdom behind her insistence.

Some days, your partner may be extra busy or unusually stressed. You should step up by making dinner, doing the chores, and asking them what they need. When you find yourself in a similar state, your partner should step up like you did. You address disagreements immediately. You don’t brush them under the rug. You engage in difficult conversations and find common ground to move forward. You never go to bed upset with your partner. You take time to resolve any conflicts before bed, even if it takes an hour.

Why do women always date the worst kind of men? It’s so annoying.” Well, I have the answer. It’s because we were lied to. Our entire childhood was a lie. I remember that in pre-school, I was playing on the swing set of our school playground when suddenly, this boy named Liam (he was 4 years old) just walked over to me and pushed me off the swings without saying a WORD. He laughed and I just walked away. I had scratches all over my arms and legs and my face was covered with dirt. It was my first time getting physically bullied during school and I was on the verge of tears the rest of the day. When I walked home, I cried to my mom and explained the entire thing to her. And you know what she said? “Oh it’s okay, Tessa. He just has a crush on you.” And from that day on, I was taught from the ripe age of 4 years old to confuse violence and affection. And if you’re a woman, I’m guessing you were taught that too. If you weren’t, you’re lucky. Because resulting from that, I became attracted to abusive men. Is that my fault? No. Did I have to unlearn that? YES. But instead of complaining about why women like certain types of men, maybe you should teach your kids that men shouldn’t be treating women poorly. We need to hold those boys accountable for their actions. No more “boys will be boys” bullshit. And we need to teach women not to ignore this type of abuse at such a young age. It’s unacceptable.

This is not a gender specific issue at all. 展开翻译 待更新 ▌评论: Kate Hayes:I remember in elementary school the rule was: If a boy hits you or is mean to you that means he is too shy to tell you that he likes you.

Like “girls like jerks&#x2F;assholes” or “ignore her and she’ll want you more”. While in a limited number of cases these may be true, overall they seem like an ingenious attempt at explaining the ideas mentioned in the answer. I remember learning this myself. When I voluntarily acted like a jerk to my then girlfriend, she just said “asshole!” and we didn’t speak for a while. That was a lifelong lesson. Such a statement is probably an overcorrection of the whole “nice guy problem”, which, again, quite simply, is about the problem of expecting something from a woman just for being “nice” to her. And the ignoring part is just about not seeming (or actually not being) needy to the point of obsession. Everyone begins to feel smothered at some point, and it becomes rather uncomfortable. It really goes for both parties. Relying on the other person for personal fulfillment rather than actually having a life and goals makes the relationship tasteless and redundant. Anyway, thanks for a good answer. ▌词汇: turn sb. off: to make someone feel that they are not attracted to you in a sexual way使丧失性兴趣，反义词: turn on ingenious: &#x2F;ɪn’dʒinɪəs&#x2F; an ingenious plan, idea, or object works well and is the result of clever thinking and new ideas〔计划、主意或物体〕精巧的，巧妙的 https://qr.ae/pGdSAr","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"Why, when parents argue in front of a young child, does the child seem to favor the aggressor","path":"/2022/03/07/2022/2022-03-07-Why-when-parents-argue-in-front-of-a-young-child-does-the-child-seem-to-favor-the-aggressor/","content":"Why, when parents argue in front of a young child, does the child seem to favor the aggressorDiane Cavaness, I taught middle school science for 37 years 1M views · 9.8KUpvotes 1964, I’m 8, my brothers are 6 and 10.

In recent years, with the gradual growth of China’s economic and military power, The U.S. government regards China as an attack target and keeps spreading rumors and has been advocating the “China threat” to the outside world. It advocates that China will become the world’s superpower and threaten the security of other countries with its continuous rapid economic growth. Because the United States is afraid that the position of “America First” will not be maintained, it fantasizes that China will become a country with strong economic and military power.

During the summer, the Russian gas argument remains important to replenish reserves for the following winter, but this leaves more time to try to find alternative solutions, even if it is difficult.

Most of us have been conditioned to think that the way to get someone to like us is by doing nice little favors for them, thereby demonstrating that we are a thoughtful and dependable person. Old Benji thought differently. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 Franklin once had a very powerful political rival who was hellbent on making his life miserable. Franklin knew that it would be beneficial to have this man on his side, but instead of groveling for his approval, he took a counter-intuitive approach. He knew his rival was in possession of a very rare and valuable book, and simply asked him to borrow it. After a few days, he returned it with a thank you note and, surprisingly, his rival became his friend. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 What Franklin tapped into is a well-known psychological principle known as cognitive dissonance. Basically, cognitive dissonance is the tension that results from having two contradictory beliefs in our mind at the same time. This stress is uncomfortable, so we automatically alter one of our beliefs to conform with the other to resolve this conflict. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 In the case of Franklin, his rival held the belief: “I do not like Benjamin Franklin.” Upon doing him the favor, however, he was forced to come to terms with another belief: “It’s a pain in the ass to do favors for other people, so I only do favors for people I like.” These two beliefs are in conflict, and since he cannot un-loan the book, he was forced to soften and eventually reverse his ill-will towards Franklin. The secret of the Benjamin Franklin effect is this: If you want people to like you, ask them to do favors for you. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 ▌评论: Feifei Wang I remember a similar experiment: Two group of people are asked to participate an activity.

I was in elementary school at the time. The boy’s family lived in an enormous mansion. It was grand. It was glorious. Every nook and cranny of that building seemed to exude power, wealth, success. Walking up to the main door, I was utterly in awe of the size of… everything. Then I went inside. And it was… empty. Not literally empty, there were chairs, sofas, the largest television set I had ever seen and some lamps. But the house had no books. The house had few pictures. And there were no parents to be seen. I asked were my friends’ father was? At work, the answer went. He was always at work. His mother was “sick”, on bed with a headache. Every time I was there, and I was there five or six times, dad was away at work, mom was sick with a headache. Looking back I’m almost certain the woman was an alcoholic. The man a workaholic. My friend was raised more or less by his older siblings. Our house was small. Our families deeply involved. Life was simple… but it felt full. Theirs, though outwardly grand, felt empty. Just visiting that eery house a handful of times reminded me of how good I had it. ▌评论: Edie: My favorite place to live while growing up was with my Grandmother.

The house was crowded, loud and full of love, laughs and great food. It was absolute bliss for me. Jean-Marie Valheur: I feel you! My own grandparents’ home, too, was a magical place. It was big. But full. So many items, so many photos, so many artifacts, each with their own unique story.

After we left to walk back, I glanced at the bill and realized that it was way too low. The cashier had scanned everything in front of us - we heard the beeps and tones, etc., but many items just had not made it to the total. As I recall, we had been undercharged about 30% to 40%. We walked back and spoke to the manager. After he realized that we were not complaining about being overcharged or that the cashier was making errors (we were very clear about that!), he went over the register and realized that it wasn’t working properly. I guess many people had paid less than they should have - certainly that day! He shut the register down, thanked us, and waved us out!

I was in 2nd grade. My mom decided to get me a flip phone through Tracfone to text her if my blood sugar drops or if the nurse doesn’t show up to give me my insulin dose. Every other year after that I got a new Tracfone for Christmas. When I turned 12 or 13, I asked my mom for a newer, better phone. I had just moved to the high school (7th-12th grade) and everyone else had nice iPhones. I knew my mom couldn’t afford an iPhone so I searched eBay for any phone that would do more than a cheap Tracfone. At my school, teachers allow students to use a phone to search things, take pictures of dissections or powerpoints, or do our online assignments. I wanted to be able to be like everyone else and not have to go to get a teacher to unlock the room to the laptops to be able to do what others do or have to use a dictionary and have homework because it took too long to find the definitions. I found a cheap android phone by the company Blu and my mom bought it for me. I loved it. My mom couldn’t afford data so I used the school’s WiFi. About 2 years later, I wanted an iPhone. I got bullied for being poor and having a phone that became slow and was considered cheap. My mom got me a refurbished iPhone 6s Plus for Christmas 2016. I’m still using this phone and I love it. Yes, I’d LOVE to have the newest iPhone but I’m very thankful to have this phone. My family hasn’t had an income for 4 years yet my mom figured out a way to get me a better phone that would last a while. I’m NOT telling you that this is what you should do. What I’m saying is ask her why she thinks she needs an iPhone. Ask her why she feels that way. Try to compromise with her. But hear her out. Teenagers often feel as if their feelings are invalid and that we don’t have good points. Have a conversation, don’t yell or raise your voice or have an attitude that screams “I’m better than you and only my points and views are valid”.

That beautiful ( though toothless) smile was still there, as was the light in her eyes that has never dimmed. And I held her and realized, “my God I will always love this woman”. And above all, in those eyes I saw that she feels the same about old, arthritic and wrinkled me. ▌评论: Ken Simpson:In my basement, I have a small metal lockable box. The kind that is typically used to keep cash in at garage sales. In that box is a picture of my wife. She was 20 years old and worked in a supermarket. Back then cashiers wore white uniforms, similar to a nurse’s outfit. Anyhow, she is just standing, smiling, in her white dress. That’s all. No sexy. Just standing, and smiling. When I look at her now, 50 years later, that’s what I see. I swear, in my eyes she hasn’t changed a bit. I don’t know how that works, but it does. ▌词汇: anecdote: &#x2F;‘ænɪkdot&#x2F; a short story based on your personal experience〔基于个人经历的〕轶事，趣闻: The book is full of amusing anecdotes about his life in Japan. 这本书里全是他在日本生活的趣闻轶事。 dentures: &#x2F;‘dɛntʃɚz&#x2F; a set of artificial teeth worn by someone who does not have their own teeth any longer（一副）假牙 arthritic: &#x2F;ɑr’θraɪtɪs&#x2F; suffering from or caused by arthritis 患关节炎的; 关节炎造成的 https://qr.ae/pGE1mH","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What are ten truths everyone should accept in life?","path":"/2022/01/29/2022/2022-01-29-What-are-ten-truths-everyone-should-accept-in-life/","content":"What are ten truths everyone should accept in life?Sherry Cam, Psychological Counselor(2014-present), LAJan 20 564.9k Views · 10k Upvotes If it doesn’t open, it’s not your door.

Being single is Normal thing. Before entering into Relationship , financial independence is must ,specially for girls. Dont downgrade any girl for being single even near by 30s. Dont measure salary to give respect to Guys. Purchasing a car is a liability, owning site is appreciating asset. If you have 10 lakhs and are thinking about purchasing of a Car , go for purchasing agricuture land in near by small village instead. Instead of purchasing Car ,go for Cab, mostly it costs less than maintainace fee of Car per Month. If your sister wants to study further, let her please. Dont depend tooo much on your spouse. Household chores is basic thing , every body should learn and do. Do have Driving License. Invest in Liquid funds which you can get liquadated in urgency easily. Government job is not compulsory. Dont take Relatives so seriously , the demotivating relatives are passing clouds. Love making is different from having Sex, if your partner forced to have sex before Marriage Dont accept if you are not ready emotionally. Take a journey with yourself to New places. Show emotional attachements to only very very closed ones. Dont make other people to accept your past, you are right at that situations in your own way. You are not tooo old. At this stage , most of the parents get Health issues , take Health Insurance. If you are not satisfied with your Job, try to do online Business ( Flipkart, Amazon ) by selling local products which is famous in your Home town.

Now, I know people think it’s a gift but no, really no. They are unnecessary &amp; painful obstructions. The monthly Niagara falls accompanied by loose motion and weird cramps. Periods are ridiculous. Childbirth is obviously a shitstorm and there are all kinds of idiocies related to pregnancy that a good engineer could have designed out. Being seen as a baby factory. It’s my womb, I’ll decide if I want to put it to use. Not feeling safe. I’d love to just be able to go for a walk alone when it’s dark out but the risks are too high. Waxing, shaving or threading. Basically, feeling the constant need to look a certain way due to societal pressure. Having my looks matter more than my work or talent. Not always, but sometimes. So many boys who wanna be our “friend” aren’t actually looking for friendship but hoping for something more. It feels kinda shitty. Not being as naturally physically strong, knowing that any man could easily overpower me. People assuming that me liking other women just means I’m kinky or want a threesome.

I didn’t want to fall into the trap that so many guys fall into of just trying to date the hottest possible woman with no regard for other factors. Looks surely matter and she’s beautiful—but she has other things going on too. She’s an archaeology professor at USF, with a focus on digital archaeology, so she is scanning artifacts and various cool things. She spent years living on excavations in Europe and Turkey (her focus is Bronze Age Archaeology). Like most people with a Ph.D., she’s super motivated, smart, and fun to talk to. If you haven’t noticed, I have an eclectic set of interests and consume a lot of information. In the past, I’ve had girlfriends roll their eyes and call me a weirdo when I start talking about goofy niche topics (things I write about here on Quora). Unsurprisingly, she doesn’t roll her eyes. Her name is Laura. We collaborate a lot on life and work decisions. She’s an editor for several academic journals so she’s always great at giving me feedback about my stuff. She’s not afraid to tell me when my writing sucks and needs work. It makes me better at what I do. I got lucky. ▌评论: Indicus:I’m not going to focus on the fact that both of you are good-looking as that’s bloody obvious. Rather, I’d like to zero in on the fact that you found someone who can relate to you and your interests. That to me is far, far, far more valuable than their external beauty. Don’t know why it makes me so happy for you.

Your ex belongs to your past, move on. Never hope on marrying someone when almost 70% of their family members don’t like you. The probability of the marriage not lasting is very high and you’re probably not going to enjoy the relationship. There is a distinct difference between dating for love and dating for sex. Always understand the main reason why you’re venturing into a relationship. Never fall in love when you are lonely, the consequences are going to be a harsh one. As long as it is still a relationship, never reveal your full potential or secrets to whoever you are dating. Your personal development should come first before relationships. People who you are in relationships with can still leave you but you can never leave yourself, meaning never compromise your adventures and dreams for anyone. Avoid relationships that seems to be too good to be true at the beginning. When the other person is rushing things too fast, don’t get carried away with romance and sex. Slow down and be careful because this is how people get hooked on to narcissistic partners. Never date someone that gives commands and doesn’t respect you. The probability of emotional abuse is very high. Never date anybody that doesn’t know how to give but knows only how to take. Never date anyone with the mindset of changing their character, attitude, and behaviors. Remember, you can never raise an adult! ▌评论: Cyrus Lapie:Never get into a romantic relationship when you don’t have work or enough money to sustain a family of at least four.

Then you look in the mirror and realize they say that about you, too. Your mind is as sharp as ever, and you feel like you have learned a few things, too, maybe even a bit of wisdom. But you feel more aches and pains. You don’t recover from hard work as quickly. I developed inflammatory arthritis at 27 which turned me into an 88 year old, so I suppose my experience may be unique. You have noticed that women age better than men. And that includes you. You consider how long it took to get to 45, and if you make it to 90, then you get to redo all you have already experienced—the glass is indeed only half empty. You are too old to be a sports star, but very young for a politician. You take care of children while caring for ailing parents. It is a very stressful time. Very stressful. And if your parents are gone, you grieve them. You even miss the hard times and would like them back because you still were a son or daughter. Now you’re just a parent. Or not. You no longer can use youth as an excuse for doing dumb shit. But you are probably not interested in doing crazy shit anymore, either. Why? Because you are 45. ▌评论: Chris Fernandez-Packham:How well people age is down to genetics, diet, lifestyle and presentation. Frankly most men make little too no effort on their appearance and look dreadful when they don’t need to. Often middle aged guys dress badly, neglect skin care and hygiene, and are either lazy or immature. They create their own problems in that regard. But since most men aren’t as judged on their appearance as women, they aren’t as incentivised. Plus men in manual labour work in harsh conditions that prematurely age them. ▌词汇: inflammatory: &#x2F;ɪn’flæmə’tɔri&#x2F; an inflammatory disease or medical condition causes inflammation 引发炎症的 arthritis: &#x2F;ɑr’θraɪtɪs&#x2F; a disease that causes the joints of your body to become swollen and very painful 关节炎 ailing: &#x2F;‘elɪŋ&#x2F; ill and not likely to get better 生病的，身患痼疾的 https://qr.ae/pGEHPz","tags":["Quora文选","2022年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"What was the best piece of relationship advice you were given by your parents or another adult?","path":"/2021/08/22/2021/2021-08-22-What-was-the-best-piece-of-relationship-advice-you-were-given-by-your-parents-or-another-adult/","content":"What was the best piece of relationship advice you were given by your parents or another adult?Dushka Zapata, I also write about life on Instagram 109.6k Views · 8.2k Upvotes One afternoon a long time ago (we must have been around fourteen years old) a friend of mine was talking to his dad. “I am in love with a girl” he said, “and I’d like to know how to keep her by my side.” “You can’t” his dad said. “You can’t keep her. The best you can do is give her whatever she lacks.” “Like, gifts? Like what?” “No, no” said his dad. “I am not talking about stuff. I am talking about how she feels about her place in her life. Does she go through a lot of uncertainty? Give her stability. Does she feel in any way trapped? Give her freedom. Does she feel she does not matter? Give her the best quality of your attention. Does she feel things are always turbulent? Give her peace.” I have thought about this advice for decades, and the distinction between “completing” someone and providing a counterpoint in their life. The most fortunate relationships are a natural match between what a person lacks and what the other cannot wait to give. ▌翻译: 很久以前的一个下午（我们那时候一定是14岁左右），我的一个朋友正在和他的父亲谈话。 他说：”我爱上了一个女孩”，”我想知道如何才能把她留在我身边。”“你不能”，他爸爸说，”你不能留住她，你能做的最好的事就是给她她所缺少的东西。”“比如呢？礼物？还是什么？”“不，不”，他爸爸说，”我不是在谈论物质类的东西，我说的是她对自己在生活中位置的那种感受，比如她是否经历了很多不确定的事情？那么就给她安定。她是否感到被束缚住？那么就给她自由。她是否觉得自己并不重要？那么就多给她些关注。她是否觉得事情总是令她忐忑不安？那么就给她平静。” 几十年来我一直在思考这个建议，以及“让某个人完整”和“在他们的生活中互补”之间的区别。 最幸运的恋爱关系是一个人所缺乏的东西和另一个人迫不及待要给予的东西能够自然匹配上。 ▌评论: Doug Armey: Great insight Dushka.

If you want to be an effective communicators, let others talking about themselves and their interests. Do not try to be the man your father would want you to be.

Pay Attention to the smell of your home when you come back from a trip - that’s what it smells like to guests all the time, you just get used to it. No matter how much your workplace pushes “team building” and “family culture” - remember, they’re not your friends and it’s still a workplace. If you’re stuck on an annoying call, put your phone on airplane mode instead of just hanging up. The other person will see “call failed” instead of “call ended”.

The older owner, who had been bothered by the noise for a long time, had a really good idea instead of scolding the kids. He called the children over to him: “Children, the noise you make sounds very nice, I’ll give you a pound a day if you keep going like this.” So he gave the kids a pound a day. In the second week he called the children over again: “Children, my money is scarce, I can only give you fifty pence, not a pound.” Now three weeks had passed and the old man called the children over to him for the last time: “Children, unfortunately I have no money, so I can’t give you any more.” The children: “No money, no noise” and so they stopped rubbing the sticks on the balcony railing. ▌评论: ΛΝDΞRONΞ:Knowing me as a kid I would have responded with, “no problem sir, I’ll make the sound for free.” ▌翻译: 当孩子们在放学回家的路上经过一栋老房子时，他们总是用棍子在阳台的栏杆上摩擦，他们很享受这声音。年长的主人被这种声音困扰了很久，后来他想到一个非常好的主意来结束这个事儿，他的方法却不是责骂孩子们。 他把孩子们叫到他身边，”孩子们，你们发出的声音非常好听，如果你们继续这样的话，我每天给你们一英镑”，孩子们孩子继续，于是他每天给孩子们一英镑。 在第二个星期，他又把孩子们叫了过来，说：”孩子们，我的钱不多了，我只能给你们50便士，不能给你们一英镑了。” 现在三个星期过去了，老人最后一次把孩子们叫到他身边，说：”孩子们，不幸的是我现在没钱了，所以我不能再给你们了，谢谢你们给我带来的声音。” 孩子们说：”没钱，就没有声音”，于是他们就再也没在阳台栏杆上摩擦过木棍。 ▌词汇: railing: a metal fence that is made of a series of upright bars 围栏，栏杆","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"2020年12月(微信)文章汇总","path":"/2020/12/31/2020/2020年12月文章汇总/","content":"2020年12月 Quora高赞 | 学习的终极目的是什么？这是我读过的最好的回答 “You name it.”的意思可不是让你取个名字 别人问你“好吃吗？”的时候到底是什么意思？| 歪解 推荐一款比微信截图好用N多倍的截图软件 | 神器 Quora | 在中国他们都会这样做，却从不说“我爱你” “family”是家庭，”immediate family”是什么意思？ 这款搜书神器，覆盖全网电子书，承包你的书单 Quora | 为什么生活如此艰辛？ “boys will be boys”，用这句形容男孩子最贴切 Quora | 30岁前必须要做的10件事情有哪些？ 【软件分享】秒开PDF，这款不到5M的神级阅读器值得收藏 Quora | 你的另一半儿给过你哪些惊喜？ 火爆Tik Tok的”today years old”，并不是在说几岁了 推荐一款看美剧学单词的APP！ Quora | 真正幸福的情侣间都有哪些习惯？ Quora | 世纪难题：老妈和老婆掉水里，先救谁？ 好用到爆的布尔运算在PPT中怎么用？ Quora | 许多优秀的人选择单身的真正理由是什么？ 10件25岁之后才会明白的事，满足任何一件，都说明你真的是个大人了 “I wasn’t born yesterday.”不能直译成我昨天才出生！ Quora | 什么样的人不会成功？ 推荐3个宝藏英语学习小程序！ “You’re telling me!”不要翻译成你在教我做事啊 2020年11月 Quora | 有哪些价值10万赞的照片？ 高校寒假时间公布！(附相关词汇) “Tell me about it.”，千万别翻译成快告诉我吧 Quora | 你有哪些瞒着父母的小秘密？结局令人感动 Quora | 成功的定义是什么？ 不用第三方软件，教你用PPT制作二维码 Quora | 一个有趣的小故事：谁才是真正的强盗？！ 数学不会就是不会 “stand up”是站起来，”stand sb up”是什么意思？ Quora | 关于拜登你知道哪些别人不知道的事儿？川普不可能有这经历 分享4个英文阅读APP “call”是打电话，”a close call”是什么意思？跟电话可没关系 Quora | 真正幸福的情侣间都有哪些习惯？ “love handles”是身体哪个部位？你最想减掉它 Quora | 作为一个中国人是一种什么样的体验？ 她说“你是个好人”到底是什么意思？ “on cloud nine”是说要上天吗？ Quora | 你后悔为拜登投票吗？美国网友这样评价川普 一辈子做到这3件事就足够了！ “put on”是穿上，”put 10 years on”是什么意思 Quora | 人民日报点赞了这条回答：你去过的哪个国家和描述的完全不一样？China！ “Break a leg!” 可不是“打断腿”的意思，而是在祝福你！ Quora | 你还在和你约会过的第一个人保持联系吗？ “You don’t say”，可不是让你闭嘴，千万别误会！ Quora | 一生中最该做的10件事是什么？ Quora | 哪些图能定义什么才是真爱？ “You can say that again”，不是你再说一个试试，而是在夸你！ Quora | 为什么大多数的人的梦想都没成真？ 什么才是真正的朋友？ Quora | 晚上应该养成哪些好习惯？ Boys will be boys! 男人都这样吗？！ Quora | 当年火爆QQ空间的一篇文章英文版：当我从11楼跳下…… 表达No！这10个句子教你如何优雅地拒绝别人 2020年10月 Quora | 有哪些真实故事证明这个世界并不公平？ Quora | 什么才是真正的成熟？ 真正的强者不需要向每个人都证明自己~ Quora | 有哪些最触动人心的小故事？ Quora | 这世上最好和最坏的感觉是什么？ Quora | 真正成熟的爱情是什么样的？ 一个结果惊人且有趣的英语小测试！ Quora | 一个有趣的小故事：喜欢的人不喜欢我，我很痛苦，该怎么办？ 表达”赞同”除了说Ok之外，还有这30种说法 Quora | 维持长久婚姻的真相是什么？ 「神器推荐」告别百度文库，这款阅读器帮你免费下载任何文档 Quora | 老外奇葩提问“中国有电脑吗？” 中国网友的机智回答 Quora | 你有哪些好的建议要送给一个20多岁的人？ Quora | 有哪些大多数人没听说过的新发明？把人逼疯的验证码原来还在做这么有意义的事儿 . 这篇教你打出朋友圈的这种特殊字体！ Quora | 晚上应该养成哪些好习惯？ 外国人问「How are you?」时到底应如何回答？ Quora | 随着年龄的增长，才发现这些道理都太对了！你能做到几条？ 好消息！2021初会考生备考指南来啦，轻松高分上岸！ Quora | 你听过最好的恋爱建议是什么?

I worked there for one year, and to my own surprise, I saved my entire salary. Not for one month, but for one whole year. No exception, every single penny saved, suppressing all the urges to buy anything for myself for one whole year. And at the end of one year, I had 804$ in my account. Using which, I bought a couch and a dining table to my home, which was a long time dream of my mom. That was a moment when I watched my dad helping the truck driver to carry the furniture inside, and my mom are excited. And that’s when I had this epiphany Damn I grew up :) ▌翻译: 你在哪一刻突然感觉自己长大了？ 我的第一份工作是学校老师，工资待遇是每月67美元。我在那里工作了一年，令我自己都感到惊讶的是我把自己的工资全部都存了起来。不是一个月的，而是整整一年的。无一例外，每一分钱都存了下来，整整一年的时间里我压制住了自己买任何东西的冲动。 那一年结束时我的账户里有804美元。用这些钱我给家里买了一张沙发和一张餐桌，这是我妈妈长久以来的梦想。那一刻，我看着爸爸帮着卡车司机把家具搬进屋里，妈妈都很兴奋。 这时我才顿悟，我真的长大了：) ▌词汇: urge: a strong wish or need强烈的欲望; 迫切的要求; 冲动 （urge to do sth）He could no longer resist the urge to go and see Amanda. 他再也抗拒不了去看阿曼达的强烈欲望。 epiphany: a Christian holy day on January 6th that celebrates the day when the Three Kings came to see the baby Jesus〔基督教 1 月 6 日的〕主显节〔为纪念三博士拜见圣婴耶稣的节日〕","tags":["Quora文选","2020年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"Why do we need to study?","path":"/2020/12/15/2020/2020-12-15-Why-do-we-need-to-study/","content":"Why do we need to study?Rajan Singh, CEO ConceptOwl, Ex-IPS, IITian, Wharton MBA 180.2k Views · 15.1k Upvotes Two months ago, I asked a bunch of class 10th kids in a Trivandrum school: “Why do we have to study Quadratic(二次的) equations and all this Maths you are going through? Your parents also studied these things, but are they using it?“ You must have seen the delight in the students’ eyes that someone finally asked this question! Some of them said, “Yes sir, we also wonder why all it is needed. But it is in the syllabus(教学大纲) - so we have to study.” Here is what I told them. “When you go to a gym, you lift weights or do biceps curls(二头肌蜷曲), bench press(卧推), or things like that. Why do you do that? In real life, how often do you have to do a biceps curl like movement to lift something? The reason we do these exercises is to build our strength and stamina so that we can respond to any situation where we need physical strength. Even more importantly, it improves our overall health parameters and quality of life. Similarly, the reason we study maths or any other subject is that they help build our mental muscle, develop logical thinking, and help us make sense of the world by recognizing patterns. By studying, we are able to build mental models about the world, so that we can respond to situations more smartly than a monkey or an ape(大猩猩) would do.” That, in a nutshell, is my answer to this question. I also hope that we encourage our children to ask more of these questions and engage them in a meaningful discussion so that we produce thinking citizens, and not compliant robots. ▌词汇: quadratic：&#x2F;kwɑˈdrætɪk&#x2F; (adj.) 二次的；(n.) 二次方程式； syllabus：&#x2F;‘sɪləbəs&#x2F; (n.) (pl ~es) list of subjects, topics, texts, etc included in a course of study 教学大纲: ‘Hamlet’ is on this year’s English literature syllabus. 《哈姆雷特》是本学年英国文学教学大纲中规定的作品。 biceps：&#x2F;‘baɪsɛps&#x2F; (n.) (pl unchanged 复数不变) large muscle at the front of the upper arm, which bends the elbow 二头肌: His biceps is&#x2F;are impressive. 他臂力过人。 stamina：&#x2F;‘stæmɪnə&#x2F; (n.) ability to endure much physical or mental strain; long-lasting energy and resilience; staying-power 精力; 耐力; 韧劲: Marathon runners need plenty of stamina. 参加马拉松长跑要有耐力。 nutshell：(n.) 概括 You know, that’s it in a nutshell. 那是对我最好的概括。 compliant：(adj.) ~ (withsb&#x2F;sth) (usu derog 通常作贬义) (too) willing to comply (with other people, with rules, etc) （对於他人﹑ 规章等）（过於）顺从的, 百依百顺的, 惟命是听的。 ▌翻译: 我们为什么要学习？ 两个月前，我在特里凡得琅的一所学校里问了一群10年级的孩子， “为什么我们要学习二次方程和你们正在学习的所有这些数学知识? 你们的父母也学过这些东西，但他们现在用得着这些东西吗？” 学生们眼中满是喜悦，终于有人提出这个问题了！ 他们有的说：”是的先生，我们也很奇怪为什么要学这些东西。但这些都在教学大纲中，所以我们必须得学习。” 如下是我告诉他们的： “当你去健身房的时候，你会举重或做肱二头肌卷曲、卧推或类似的事情。你为什么要这样做呢？在现实生活中，你有多少次要做肱二头肌卷曲这样的动作才能举起东西？ 我们做这些运动的原因是为了增强我们的力量和耐力，以便我们能够应对任何需要体力的情况。更重要的是，它能提高我们的整体的健康水平和生活质量。 同样，我们学习数学或任何其他科目的原因是它们有助于锻炼我们的逻辑思维，并帮助我们通过识认识事物的运行模式来理解这个世界。 通过学习，我们能够建立世界的模型，这样我们就能比猴子或大猩猩更聪明地应对出现在生活里的各种情况。” 简而言之，以上就是我对这个问题的回答。 我还希望我们能鼓励孩子们提出更多的这类问题，让他们参与更有意义的讨论中来，以便我们能培养出有思想的学生，而不是言听计从的机器人。","tags":["Quora文选","2020年","🎨精选"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What is a waste of time?","path":"/2020/12/15/2020/2020-12-15-What-is-a-waste-of-time/","content":"What is a waste of time?Chetan Ghodeswar, Government College of Engineering, Jalgaon (2019) 104.4k Views · 3.6k Upvotes Love is a waste of time.

Advising People is a waste of time. None is going to follow your advise ,people do what they want to do. Staring at girls is a waste of time. To see WhatsApp status updated of others is a waste of time. It’s always better to mute them. Debate or discussion (discussion always turns into debate) on politics is a waste of time.

Upvoting to this answer is not a waste of time. ▌评论: Tulip Brady： I agree with all except for the 1st one. Love is the only thing in life that is definitively NOT a waste of time. Young love can last. Love is the one thing you should put all your energy into, or most. I’m talking self love, family love, couple love, stranger love. It is the foundation of Human nature. It’s the misconception that it’s a waste time that makes it fleeting for most. If you know the true meaning of love then you know it is of the utmost important. Gurmeet Singh： In some cases maturity not comes with age. It comes with incident. Maturity is core element for successful love. Here I am talking about mental maturity. ▌词汇: misconception: an idea which is wrong or untrue, but which people believe because they do not understand the subject properly 错误想法，误解; 错误印象 fleeting: lasting for only a short time 短暂的，飞逝的 ▌翻译: 哪些事情最浪费时间？ 恋爱是一种浪费时间的行为。特别是如果你在22岁之前谈恋爱，那就是浪费时间。（见评论区） 只是和朋友谈论你的或者他迷恋的对象（却什么也不做）是浪费时间。 过分担心未来是浪费时间。 给别人提建议是浪费时间。没有人会听从你的建议，人们只做他们想做的事。 盯着女孩看是浪费时间。 看别人的WhatsApp状态更新是浪费时间，最好的办法是给它静音。 辩论或争论（辩论总是变成争论）政治是浪费时间。 浏览Ins和Facebook页面浪费时间。 每一次大学里的讲座都去参加，这是在浪费时间。 所以，如果你喜欢这个答案，那就点赞吧，点赞并不浪费时间。 Tulip Brady： 除了第一条，其他的我都同意。爱情是人生中唯一绝对不会浪费时间的事情，年轻时候的爱情是可以长久的。爱情是你应该投入所有精力的一件事，或者说是最重要的一件事。我说的是自爱，对家庭的爱，夫妻之间的爱，对陌生人的爱。它是人性的基础。对大多数人来说，正是因为误以为它是在浪费时间，所以它才会昙花一现。如果你知道爱的真谛，那么你就知道它才生命中是最重要的。 Gurmeet Singh： 在某些情况下，成熟不是看年龄而是看你经历过多少事情。成熟是成功爱情的核心要素，这里我说的是心理上的成熟。","tags":["Quora文选","2020年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"In Chinese culture, how common is it to regularly say, \"I love you\" to family?","path":"/2020/12/13/2020/2020-12-13-In-Chinese-culture,-how-common-is-it-to-regularly-say-I-love-you-to-family-and-significant-others/","content":"In Chinese culture, how common is it to regularly say, “I love you” to family?Dakota Lim, Updated February 29, 2016 289.9k Views · 1.8k Upvotes Very common to hear parents say “I love you” in the Chinese culture. BUT, these words must be translated. Here is the Chinese to English translation of“I love you”: Words“Have you eaten today?”“ate!”“Eat some more!”“Have this soup it will build strong blood.” ActionsMothers will give the best pieces of meat to their children. Parents whose children are studying at universities will wonder and worry if their children are healthy or coming down with a cold or flu. They will make phone calls to ask their children if they are having enough to eat. Mothers will receive hand-me-down children’s clothing from friends and relatives and will take them apart and sew them into astonishing clothing that their children will like wearing. Parents will continue to wear broken down shoes and slippers so their children can have shoes that fit well to wear to school so their feet won’t hurt while studying. If you tell Chinese parents your friends don’t have enough money to eat they will say, “Bring them home for dinner, I will make good soup for them.” And will place the best pieces of meat on their plates just as they do for their own children. They will make deep sacrifices to pay for books, school supplies, and tuition so their children will be able to have a safe and flourishing future through education. (Can you see the vision that comes from their heart?) Parents even express their love openly when introducing their children to people. The tone of their voice says, “I love you” when they say, “He&#x2F;she is my son&#x2F;daughter, he&#x2F;she went to XXX college.” The pride in their voices say, “I love them so much, they are my life. I live for them.“ Can you feel their love? ▌翻译: 中国父母会轻易说出“我爱你”吗？ 在中国文化中，经常听到父母说 “我爱你”，但是这三个字都是藏着这些话里：“你今天吃饭了吗？”“吃了！”“多吃点！”“多喝这个汤，可以补血” 父母的行为 母亲会把最好的肉片留给孩子吃。 子女在大学读书的父母经常会担心自己的孩子是否健康、是否感冒了，他们会打电话询问孩子在外面是否吃得饱。 妈妈们会收到亲朋好友送来的旧衣服，她们有时候会把这些衣服拆开再缝成孩子们喜欢穿的好看的衣服。 有些家长会继续穿破旧的鞋，好让他们的孩子在学校里能穿一双合脚的鞋子，让孩子在学习的时候脚不疼。 如果你告诉父母，你的朋友没有钱吃饭，他们会说：”带他们回家吃饭吧，我会给他们煲好汤”，并且会把最好的肉块放在他们的盘子里，就像给自己的孩子吃一样。 他们会做出挺大的牺牲来支付书本、学习用品和学费，让他们的孩子能够通过教育拥有一个辉煌的未来。 父母甚至在向人们介绍自己的孩子时会公开表达自己的爱心。当他们说：”他&#x2F;她是我的儿子&#x2F;女儿，他&#x2F;她上了XXX大学 “的时候，他们的语气就是在说“我爱你，我很骄傲”，他们语气中的自豪感是在表达“我很爱他们，他们是我的生命。我为他们而活。” 你能感受到他们的爱吗？ ▌词汇: hand-me-down: a piece of clothing which has been used by someone and then given to another person〔某人穿过传给别人的〕旧衣服: She refused to wear hand-me-downs.她不愿意穿别人穿过的旧衣服。 slipper: a light soft shoe that you wear at home 室内便鞋，拖鞋 https://www.quora.com/In-Chinese-culture-how-common-is-it-to-regularly-say-I-love-you-to-family-and-significant-others?top_ans=15046897","tags":["Quora文选","2020年","🎨精选"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What kind of people will not succeed in life?","path":"/2020/11/25/2020/2020-11-25-What-kind-of-people-will-not-succeed-in-life/","content":"What kind of people will not succeed in life?Akram Khan, lived in 10 Countries and Travelled to 35 427.8k Views · 32.3k Upvotes Some intelligent minds have quoted tons of valuable information under this question. Therefore, I would like to go the different way. What kind of people will not succeed in life? Well, as an answer to this question, I would say: Once there was an old blacksmith who was famous for making the best swords in the country. The soldiers came to him from different cities, even from distant borders and he made magnificent weapons for all of them. And the buyers, then boasted of their military achievements - everyone was returning from campaigns with success. One day a young guy came to him and said: - Master, please, make the best sword in the world, I want to go on campaign with King. Can you make it? - Sure, I can but it will take 1 year to make it - 1 year is too long - But you have to wait, otherwise, it won’t be the best sword in the world. The young guy agreed to come after a year. The blacksmith said, “Meanwhile, you must learn war skills from a reputed master”. The young man returned after a year. Blacksmith handed him his sword. During the war, this man showed high war skills and conquered all of his targets. After sometime, he returned to the blacksmith to say thanks for the best sword. Blacksmith said, “It’s not the sword that won the battles. It’s your fighting skills. You could do this with any other sword as well. I made this sword in just 2 days but I wanted you to learn extraordinary war skills, that’s why I told you to come after a year” What kind of people will not succeed? The one who doesn’t know, what he&#x2F;she needs for success. The one, who, instead of learning the required skills, focuses on proving his&#x2F;her (fake) success to others, probably won’t succeed. The one, who, continuously thinks, if I were handsome or if I were tall or if I were born in White-house or if my father were a businessman, then I would have, for sure, been a badass successful person on this planet, Probably, won’t succeed. If one spends sufficient time in learning, and never gives up, whatever, the conditions will be, I bet, no one can stop him&#x2F;her from becoming successful. Good luck! ▌翻译: 什么样的人不会成功？ 我想讲个故事作为这个问题的答案： 从前有一个老铁匠，他以制造全国最好的剑而闻名于世，士兵们从不同的城市，甚至从遥远的边境来找他，他都为他们制作了锋利的武器。而买主们，逢人都会夸耀自己的军功，因为他们每个人都是身负战功归来。 有一天，一个年轻人来找他，说： -大师，请你做一把世界上最好的剑，我想和国王一起出征，你能做出来吗？ -当然可以，不过要花一年的时间来做。 -1年太久了。 -但你一定得等，否则，就不是世上最好的剑了。 小伙子答应一年后再来。 铁匠说：”在这期间，你必须向一位有名望的师傅学习战术。” 年轻人一年后回到铁匠这里，铁匠把剑交给他。在接下来的许多场战争中，这个人表现出很高的战术，打败了他所有的敌人。过了一段时间，他回到铁匠那里，感谢铁匠给了他一把世上最好的剑。 铁匠说：”帮你赢得战斗的不是这把剑，而是你的战术，你用别的剑照样可以做到这一点。这把剑我只用了两天时间就打造出来了，但我想让你学会非凡的战术，所以我才告诉你让你一年后再来取剑。” 什么样的人不会成功？ 一个不知道为了成功需要什么的人不会成功； 一个只想证明Ta那伪成功给别人而不去学习真正技术的人可能不会成功； 一个不断地假想如果我很帅、如果我很高、如果我出生在白宫或者如果我爸是个商人的话那么我一定会成为这地球上非常成功的人，这种人可能不会成功。 如果一个人花足够的时间去学习，并且永不放弃，无论什么情况下，我敢打赌，没有人能阻止他的成功。 祝你成功！ ▌词汇: blacksmith: (also smith) (n.) person whose job is to make and repair things made of iron, esp horseshoes 铁匠（尤指马蹄铁匠）； boast: ~ (about&#x2F;of sth) talk (about one’s own achievements, abilities, etc) with too much pride and satisfaction 自夸; 自吹自擂: He’s always boasting about his children’s success at school. 他总是夸耀他的孩子们学习成绩好。 campaign: &#x2F;kæm’pen&#x2F; (n.) series of military operations with a particular aim, usu in one area 战役: He fought in the N African campaign during the last war. 在上次战争中他在北非战役参战。| series of planned activities with a particular social, commercial or political aim 运动（为某一社会的、商业的或政治的目的而进行的一系列有计划的活动）: a campaign against nuclear weapons 反对核武器运动； reputed: &#x2F;rɪ’pjutɪd&#x2F; (adj.)

The money belongs to the State. Your life belongs to you.” Everyone in the bank laid down quietly. This is called “Mind Changing Concept“. Changing the conventional way of thinking. When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her: “Please be civilized! This is a robbery and not a rape!” This is called “Being Professional“, Focus only on what you are trained to do! When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA-trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school): “Big brother, let’s count how much we got.” The older robber rebutted and said: “You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!” This is called “Experience“, Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications! After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: “Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank”. This is called “Swim with the tide“, Converting an unfavorable situation to your advantage! The supervisor says: “It will be good if there is a robbery every month.” This is called “Killing Boredom“, Personal Happiness is more important than your job. The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. The robbers were very angry and complained: “We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!” This is called “Knowledge is worth as much as gold!“ The bank manager was smiling and happy because his losses in the share market are now covered by this robbery. This is called “Seizing the opportunity“ Daring to take risks! So who are the real robbers here? 展开翻译 【全文翻译】在美国的一次抢劫案中，银行劫匪对着银行里的所有人大喊：\"不要动，钱是国家的，你们的命可是你们自己的。\"银行里的所有人都安静地躺下了。 这就是所谓的 \"思想观念改变的概念\"，所以你得改变传统的思维方式。 当一位女士很有挑逗性地躺在桌子上时，劫匪对她大喊：\"请你躺文明一点！这是抢劫，不是强奸!\" 这就是所谓的 \"专业\"，所以你应该只专注于自己所受培训的那件事儿上！ 银行劫匪回家后，受过MBA培训的小劫匪对只读完小学六年级的大劫匪说：\"大哥，我们来数数有多少钱。\"大一点的劫匪反驳说：\"你真笨，这么多钱，我们要花很长时间才能数清楚，今天晚上电视新闻会告诉咱们，咱俩到底从银行抢了多少钱！\" 这就是所谓的 \"经验\"，现在这社会，经验比纸面上的学历更重要！ 劫匪走后，银行经理让银行主管赶快报警，但主管对他说：\"等一下，我们从银行里拿出一千万来，自己用，再加上我们之前贪污的七千万\"。 这就是所谓的 \"顺应潮流 \"，你得将不利的局面转化成对自己有利的局面！ 主管说：\"要是每个月都有抢劫案，那就好了\"。 这叫 \"解闷儿 \"，个人的幸福感要比工作更重要。 第二天，电视新闻报道说，银行里有一亿美元被抢走了。劫匪们数啊数，数啊数，却只数到了2000万美元。劫匪们非常生气，抱怨道：\"我们冒着生命危险，只拿了两千万美元，银行经理弹指一挥间就拿走了8000万美元。看来，做贼不如多接受教育！\" 这就叫 \"知识就是金钱！\" 银行经理笑得合不拢嘴，因为他在股市上的损失，现在已经被这次抢劫案给弥补了。 这就叫 \"抓住机会\"，敢于冒险! 那么，这里谁才是这个故事里真正的强盗呢？！ ▌词汇: provocative: &#x2F;prə’vɒkətɪv&#x2F; provocative clothes, movements, pictures etc are intended to make someone sexually excited〔衣服、动作、图片等〕挑逗性的 civilized: a civilized society is well organized and developed, and has fair laws and customs 开化的，文明的 embezzle: &#x2F;ɪm’bez(ə)l&#x2F; to steal money from the place where you work 盗用，挪用，贪污; 侵吞 snap your fingers: to make a short, sharp noise by moving one of your fingers quickly against your thumb, for example in order to get someone’s attention or to mark the beat of music 打响指 daring: involving a lot of risk or danger, or brave enough to do risky things 勇敢的，大胆的 share: one of the equal parts into which the OWNERSHIP of a company is divided 股市，股份 https://qr.ae/pNWfAh","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2022年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"What are some of the best moments of humanity?","path":"/2020/10/14/2020/2020-10-14-What-are-some-of-the-best-moments-of-humanity/","content":"What are some of the best moments of humanity?Doha Hemida, Tue Student 39.1k Views · 1.5k Upvotes This photo is of a man wanting to jump off a bridge in London.

Don’t go out more than two nights per week. It will ruin you in the long run. Every second waiting is a lost second. Social You are the average of the 5 friends you spend the most time with. Don’t make friends with people claiming that you are their friend. It never ends well. Don’t follow the trends. Make them. Associate yourself with winners, they have more fun. Some people are a time-hole. Avoid them. ▌词汇: leaderboard: (n.) 积分榜、排行榜、通栏广告； tier: (n.) any of a series of rows (esp of seats) or parts of a structure placed one above the other 一排（尤指座位）; （阶梯式的）一层: a box in the first tier, ie in a theatre （剧院中的）第一排的一个包厢。 | As a financial advisor in a top tier company. 在一家一流的公司任财务顾问。 crap: (n.) nonsense; rubbish 胡扯; 废话: You do talk a load of crap! 你净胡说八道! side-hustle: 副业 having a side-hustle means you are self-employed - or freelance - which can give you flexibility to work when you like, but it can be risky. hustle: &#x2F;‘hʌsl&#x2F; (vt.) 催促、猛推、强夺；(vi.) 赶紧、硬挤过去、拼命挣钱；(n.) 推、奔忙、拥挤喧嚷 time-hole：时间黑洞。 https://qr.ae/TWYBVs","tags":["Quora文选","2019年"],"categories":["Quora","文选"]},{"title":"How do I impress my boss?","path":"/2019/07/18/2020/2020-07-05-How-do-I-impress-my-boss/","content":"How do I impress my boss?Asim Qureshi, January 14, CEO Jibble.io - the employee time clock app 61.4k Views · 2.5k Upvotes Next time you have a question for your boss, do the following.

Teen period is the best time for you to do something good with your life. Every hour you waste in that time is equivalent to wasting 10 hours in a later time period. I spent my 2nd semester break in one of Chennai’s largest libraries learning Java. I was also reading books like “How to get whatever you want” to improve my business skills. My 3rd semester break was spent in working with a professor on a project involved Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms. I also did a lot of coding with algorithms from CLRS. 4th semester break I spent in preparing for GRE [I had to write it early as people scared me about the new pattern that was coming that year]. Getting that monkey off my back early allowed me to fret less about what I will do after college. 5th semester break went in preparing for ACM ICPC programming contest and going to Asia regionals in Dhaka. 6th semester break went into working in a research project for which got IEEE student paper award. 7th semester break was into working on a project that got me an entry into HP’s Asian young inventors awards in Singapore. 8th semester break was spent working as Summer Research Fellow at IISc. Yes, this is a lot of bragging. Just to convince you how important is college life. There was not a single semester break I spent either at home or in travel. There were a lot of successful people I know who pretended as though they achieved without doing anything. I know how hard they worked and also how hard they worked to avoid you knowing how hard they worked. And that hardwork really paid off that time. There was a time during college when a tech company invited me to be their Chief guest for their new office inauguration and I was much younger to all the people applying for a job there — originally the folks there cleared me off to the jobseeker queue until they realised I was the one inaugurating the program. After graduation and joining work at my dream company, I spent a lot of time binge watching Netflix. That paid off too — as my career slowed down and hit a wall. My life’s momentum dropped to zero. I had to once again bring the momentum back. Every hour you spend at home or with TV during your younger years will come to bite you. Take up an internship to learn and contribute to the company. Their leaders will notice the new star. Or take up volunteering with a cause you most associate with and move the world a little closer to where you want it. Or take up a skill you could really master. Or work in a lab and really help your guide or other researchers to make their task easy [say collecting data, setting up experiments etc]. And read lots of books. You could still ignore all this and sit infront of Netflix or watch the World Cup. That could help you lot recounting stories of regret to your children and grandchildren. The reason why your teachers and parents stress so much on this is because they know how painful it is to screw up their time and endup like that.

And we have been together for a long time now! Here’s what makes us tick: We have at least one meal together. We try and be home for dinner every night. No social obligations and no work obligations stretch into the night for ‘us’ time. If I do need to go out with my coworkers, I make it a ‘happy hour’. This way I’m still home for dinner. Of course, this doesn’t always work, but 90% of the time, we make it happen. ‘Weather check in the middle of the day’. Both of us are engineers, and both our days are swamped with work. Sometimes I’m lucky if I can make time to wolf down a sandwich. While I’m doing that, I place a call to him, or he texts me. It’s a 2–5 minute call, but we make sure the other person is doing okay. ‘We date once a week’. We plan something ‘special’ once a week. Sometimes it is an impromptu beer outside, a hike during the weekends, a dinner outside on Friday night, a movie and popcorn at home, or I cook something special and light a candle.. right in the middle of the week. It works like a charm :) We hug as soon as we see each other. I can’t even tell you how good this makes me feel. Before we talk about our day, before a ‘hi’, we hug. It doesn’t matter if it is a quick one or a long one where I simply won’t let go. When something important comes up, we let the other person know right away or as soon as possible. This is important, and we make it a priority. If he sees me cooking&#x2F;cleaning, he always offers to help, and vice versa, unless of course one of us is working. No matter who wakes up first, we wish each other good morning. Nothing elaborate. A quick kiss, a quick hug, and a short whisper is more than enough. These are some of our everyday habits. It has worked wonderfully for both of us. Remember, you have to make your partner a priority.

When you’re thinking about buying something you don’t necessarily need, imagine the item in one hand and the cash in the other. Which one would you take? Never loan a friend more than you can afford to give away. If a job makes you pay money to work for them, it’s a scam. Want to find a good job after college? Make friends with as many people in your field that are on track to graduate one or two years ahead of you. Take a picture of business cards people hand you, just in case you lose them. Secretaries, tech support, and janitors are the true power in an office. Make friends with them and you’ll be able to get anything you need! If you forget someone’s name simply say, “Sorry, what was your name again?” They may look annoyed, but once they tell you their first name say, “No, I meant your last name.” The next time you stub your toe or get a cut, look away.

Tie a small piece of brightly colored fabric to your luggage. You’ll be able to spot your bag at the airport in no time! Hang a picture of a tattoo you want somewhere you’ll see it every day for a year. If you still want it after that, then it’s worth getting. Success is a state of mind. If you want success, start thinking of yourself as a success. If you are buying headphones or speakers, test them out with “Bohemian Rhapsody“.

First thing in the morning when we wake up we kiss and hug each other, it’s like a bed coffee, continuing for 10yrs. It’s a daily routine. We both call each other in the morning to check whether we have reached our respective offices. Call in lunch-time to find out whether we had our lunch; not a single day missed without calling. She always cooks and I always clean, we never complained about this to each other. Wake up early on Weekends compared to weekdays, this will give a lot of time for both of us to spend together. Typically weekend starts with a long walk or long drive together. What may come, we ensure that we never leave each other and be alone for more than 2 weeks. We were lucky enough to follow this for last 10yrs. Friday night for sure we will watch one classic old Tamil movie together on TV. Always it would be a happy ending movie, so we go to sleep light-hearted and wake up the next day early with lots of positive energy. We respect our personal spaces and when one needs this space, we don’t interfere. Our mobile phone password is known to each other and can even exchange our phones for the entire day. There is nothing called secrets. She is a Tea lover, I make fantastic tea to make her happy. I am a coffee lover and she is a fabulous coffee maker to make me happy.

When you don’t want to check your bank account because you are afraid, you should definitely check your bank account. Don’t fill “To” field in email until you are completely done with the content of email. The period key and comma key move YouTube videos one frame forward and backward respectively. Be objective instead of being subjective. e.g. if someone send you an email with no attachment then say “attachment is missing in the email” instead of “you did not send attachment along with email”. Always check the air pressure in your spare tire and learn how to use it before going to long trip. If you are nervous about public speaking, go first, and do it. If it takes less than 15 minutes to do then do it now instead of procrastinating it for later. If you are getting in a large park with your kids, take a picture of your kids, so in case you lost them at park you can show how they look like and what they’re wearing. Use the “it was my understanding” with any idea or thought when talking professionally. If your printer ran out of black ink, then change the color of font to #010101, which is 99% grey and it will work fine. If someone is not shutting up and won’t let you talk, drop something, person will pause when you go down to pick it up. Use that as an opportunity to say your point. Before doing anything, think “would an idiot do that?” and now you got your answer. always remember X% of Y is equal to the Y% of X. Always check the reader first of the gas pump machine before entering your card in it. In setting put on the “undo” option for email so you have 30 seconds time to unsend the email, you wrongly sent. Apologize less and say thank you more e.g. say “thank you for listening” instead of saying “I’m sorry i talk too much”. I never break the hug first with the person I love or getting interested. If you hate splashing because of poop drop on water, put toilet paper on the top of water in commode. If someone ask “why are you so quiet?” answer them with “Why, are you nervous?” Always remember “NO” is a complete sentence. Sometimes you type something with all CAPS on and you don’t want to rewrite it all.

Law (2006)Answered Dec 31 353k Views · 2.8k Upvotes Travel before you have children. You won’t have that time again. Traveling with children is too hard. Get your schooling done before you have children. If you go to college, use the time to read, think, and let your curiosity be satisfied. You won’t have a time in your life again that is focused on developing your mind. If you smoke, quit now. Your heart and lungs will be very damaged if you continue. Now is the chance to make a decision the 40 year old version of you will be proud of yourself. If you are an alcoholic or drug addicted, get help now before you destroy the beautiful life you could have in the future. Addiction is usually self-medicating. So you need to get to the bottom of your pain. A therapist and a psychologist can help you. Or maybe you need to change your life, such as quit a job that is killing you or think about relationships you have that are toxic. Spend time with your grandparents and parents. They won’t live forever. Build those memories. If you make money, get a IRA and start saving. Now is the time to let compound interest work for you. Keep your student loan debt low. Go to community college and transfer into a four year program if you must. Keep it low. Because the future of careers is low, and you will be a debt slave forever. Try to find a mate that is a good person. Focus on someone you can have good conversations with, someone you respect, and someone who has the same life goals. If you want children, don’t date someone who does not. If you are introverted and hate parties, avoid the extrovert. If you are a low energy individual, find someone the same. When you reach your forties, think about your life. “Have I lived the life that has challenged me while bringing out my best self? Am I proud of what I have done? Or do I feel shame that I used my life to harm myself and others?” ▌词汇: schooling: school education 学校教育 self-medicating: 自我治疗； IRA: 个人退休账户，individual retirement account； compound interest: 复利, 复息: Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest.","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2019年"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"Does life get better after 23?","path":"/2019/01/23/2019/2019-01-23-Does-life-get-better-after-23/","content":"Does life get better after 23?Prashant Motwani, Visiting Research Associate at Queen’s University Belfast (2018-present)Answered Sep 22, 2017 · Upvoted by Amala Pulavarthi, 17 years teen! 267.2k Views · 15.2k Upvotes At 23, I wanted a girlfriend At 26, I want to stay single till I get married At 23, I dreamt of IIT At 26, I dream of my own company At 23, complaints about what I don’t have were never-ending At 26, Complaints got replaced with gratitude and belief for what I already have at 23, I had no money to help someone in need At 26, I realized I don’t need money to help someone , a good heart and pure intentions is all it takes At 23, I thought no one understands me completely At 26, I try to understand others At 23, I focused on my looks At 26, I focus on my health at 23, I fought with my parents to buy me branded clothes and latest gadgets At 26, I fight with my work to spend time with my family At 23, applause and cheers were earned quite easily.

Sean Kernan, Son of Quora Answered Dec 29 ​ 98.9k Views · 9.8k Upvotes Proximity. I’ll explain. When you first start dating it’s super super easy, you (usually) hang out once, twice, thrice a week. The conditions are controlled and for small spans of time. It’s easy to keep your happy face on. Want to find out if your relationship is going to be solid? Go on a trip together. Go through the planning, then get packed, go to the airport together, be exposed to the stresses of travel, the hotels, the rental cars, the splitting of the bills, the sharing of hotel beds, the sharing of a bathroom sink for a solid 5 days. While you do this - you will likely spend 80% of your time within 5–10 feet of each other. Proximity. Over those days, you’ll quickly find out just how well you tolerate each other. Traveling is a fantastic relationship test. It keeps you in close quarters while also putting you both out of your comfort zones. Naturally good couples can spend long spans of time around each other in differing conditions. Unnaturally good couples quickly fall apart under this test. If your significant other suddenly starts getting mad at the way you brush your teeth every morning, it’s not a good sign. 展开翻译 翻译待更新 ▌词汇: solid: a solid achievement or solid work is of real, practical, and continuing value〔成就或工作〕相当好的，经得起时间考验的 proximity: &#x2F;prɑk’sɪməti&#x2F; nearness in distance or time〔距离或时间的〕接近，临近; 邻近 thrice: adv. 三次；三倍地；非常，十分； span: length of time over which sth lasts or extends from beginning to end （某事物）自始至终的持续时间或期间: the span of life 一生的时间； quarters: [pl] accommodation,esp for soldiers 住处; （尤指）营房: take up quarters in the nearest village 在最近的村中驻扎； split: the way in which something, especially money, is shared between several people〔尤指钱的〕分配: He should have split the bill with me. 简直该跟我分担账单。 significant other: your husband, wife, girlfriend, or boyfriend 重要的另一位〔指丈夫、妻子、女朋友或男朋友〕","tags":["Quora文选","🎨精选","2019年","爱情"],"categories":["🎨精选"]},{"title":"关于我","path":"/about/index.html","content":"1、“Quora文选英语”公众号负责”美版知乎“Quora文章的翻译以及英语教育资源的分享，呈现最原汁原味的高质量英语问答。——好的文章不该被埋没！ 众所周知，Quora官网需要特殊工具才能访问，但是上面有很多优秀回答，所以我就负责摘录、整理。 2、“Quora文选英语”小红书利用小红书分享一些外网上的精选词汇 各种【标点符号】用英语怎么说？ 各种【线条】用英语怎么说？ 3、“RPA小站”公众号分享各类软件、视频资源以及小技巧的分享，关注我，不走冤枉路。 我是个优秀软件重度收集者，收集各种好用的小软件，帮大家提高效率。 输入法居然还能这么用：1秒录入3万字！ 推荐3款大神们都在用的轻量型的绘图工具"}]
